{"The effectiveness of the story's thematic depth and its ability to challenge reader expectations plays a crucial role in determining surprise scores. Stories that present superficial themes or fail to engage with deeper moral or philosophical questions will likely score a 1, as they lack substance and insight. A score of 2 may be assigned to stories that touch on familiar themes but do not provide any significant insights or surprises, resulting in limited engagement. Stories that explore moderate themes with some unexpected revelations will score a 3, as they provide some depth but do not fully challenge the reader's understanding. A score of 4 is for narratives that delve into profound themes and lead to surprising insights that provoke thought and reflection, enhancing the overall experience. Finally, a score of 5 will be given to those that challenge the reader's understanding in unexpected ways, offering deep thematic explorations that resonate emotionally and intellectually, leaving a lasting impression.": 0.7180142574443196, "Stories that achieve a score of 5 on surprise are characterized by high levels of originality and creativity, containing unexpected elements that are \"not only surprising but also enhance the overall narrative experience,\" leading to a profound impact on the reader.": 0.669878027978261, "The complexity and intricacy of the plot contribute significantly to the surprise score.

A score of 3 will be awarded to stories that contain moderate complexity with some unexpected developments, but these twists may not fully capitalize on the potential for surprise. Stories with multiple layers, red herrings, or intricate plots that culminate in a surprising twist will score a 4, while those that masterfully weave complexity into a surprising ending, challenging the reader's expectations throughout the narrative and providing a satisfying resolution, will receive a score of 5.": 0.6534891462723196, "The use of narrative devices such as foreshadowing, misdirection, and symbolism is crucial in determining the surprise score.
