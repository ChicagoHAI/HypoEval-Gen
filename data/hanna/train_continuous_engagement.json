That's why it was so shocking when the winning contestant was Elvira Finkle. While humans weren't exactly perfect in all regards, they still managed to scratch their self-esteem pretty good. It was honestly frightening how they stayed healthy and happy throughout that one match. Humans could be considered the oddity.

We were played up as what we could possibly be. Well, not quite the *game*. When I was a boy my friends would ask me to come over to see the stadium. My mother would always tease me that I had to come to see this place. I don't think she understood how cliche it sounded, but I felt I would never understand the kind of normal humans that would just chuckle in disbelief, wining over their children, and leave home just a few minutes before leaving. We made plans to meet up after school, but I was told that my mother and I would be trying to get to see the stadium when it closed. It was going to be a long day, and it was going to be nice to not have to deal with being invited. I was completely engrossed in the real thing, so much so that I didn't even notice that my old classmates were staring at me. The closest one was God, the God of Vengence.

I sit down and stare into the darkness. I am taking a deep breath to calm down, so I regain my memories of what happened yesterday. I sigh. The lights are dead. I try to read my phone, but I am just a blubbering mess of stories. I seem to remember my home, our once laughing again, the very core of our relationship.

I remember before it happened, the [ CDC joked that they would have a cure \u201cwithin a week\u201d ] ( http: //www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies.htm ) when they had n't been able to cure HIV in 32 years, they had known about herpes for 2385 years and only had a treatment, and the flu remained a menace up until there were n't enough humans left to contract it. To the credit of the scientists, they all worked until the only thought they had was about their brain cravings. I had had a new \u201cstem cell\u201d treatment the year before, it helped recover some of the nerve damage i had gotten when i was young and had to have a surgery to correct a malformation. In those days, it seemed that the end to all disease and disfigurement were just around the corner, technology and biology hand in hand to save the human race. The funny thing is, my only guess to my resistance to the zombie infection and the zombies total lack of interest in me is probably due to the stem cell treatment somehow. The outbreak did n't take long, it started with a HIV like infection where only if you were bitten or zombie bodily fluids came in contact with someone, only then could you be infected. The virus became symbiotically linked to a bacterial group, then also a mold. With new methods of transmission, only the people on the ISS were safe from infection ... They got to starve to death and have a front row seat to the end of the world. By the time the infection made it here, there was no time for panic. The mold set itself up inside of buildings and anything made of wood or anywhere with standing water.. by the time it was identified, it had infected everyone. It 's spread was attributed to standing water in the water traps of sinks and toilets and their connection to the sewage system. time from infection to zombie was about 6 hours, and was mostly flu like. some people simply fell asleep never to wake with a human thought again. The thing about zombies that most zombie movies neglect is thermodynamics. Zombies do n't eat other zombies, and most animals can flee zombies or are immune. This means that a zombie must consume material to continue locomotion, and that energy must be expended to remain \u201calive\u201d. Once the zombie 's guts had rotten past usability, a zombie would only be able to live for about 32 hours. Given that the zombie would run out of ATP fairly quickly, they would spend most of that time too stiff to move. This meant that anyone who was smart enough to remain out of sight, would be able to survive. The actual \u201czombie apocalypse\u201d lasted about 3 years. Year two I went a bit crazy, I went through a mental breakdown where I assumed I myself must be a zombie and joined a horde. We chased some wildlife, and ate the remains of some survivors that starved to death. It was the sight of that rotting family that snapped me out of it, I slipped away and let the horde.. do their thing ... but that was 48 years ago, with eternal youth and a city of books and movies you can learn to do anything. So I learned to do pretty much everything. I was n't going to die anytime soon, I had a garden and traps set up within year 4. So it was easy to learn to make and do everything. One of the things i did was set up a \u201cmesh network\u201d, reprogramming WiFi routers to make a city-wide network that could allow me to monitor and automate things. Stealing some solar panels off of highway department signage and daisy-chaining them, I was able to muster enough power to keep the local radio station transmitting. I linked the computer up to my mesh network so I would n't have to set foot in there again. I set up heat sensitive cameras on every entrance into the city and tuned in random radios to my station, kinda like turning on the tv when your home alone, except with a whole city. For a whole year, I scavenged every solar panel i could find. From the bigger ones that the city put on their structures to going through offices for their pocket calculators. I scavenged other things too, Canned food, WiFi Routers, Medication, security cameras, loose wiring, movies, books, video games, Hard drives, portable PCs, IDs, Photos, phones, anything that may have held the voices and images of other people. I would also gather electric cars, with solar, i could charge them and use them. The wrecked and damaged ones could be used for parts, the ones in good condition I would store indoors to use as ether. A Camry Hybrid power cell and an alternator attached to a windmill or a solar cell could keep a couple WiFi routers chugging along for a few days. A single hybrid contains 34 of them. The mesh network also has a feature where any new nodes and unrecognized WiFi scans are reported to me.", "\u201cHey, I 've always been a little bit afraid ,\u201d I explained to her, \u201cso why not just sit down and enjoy the show ?\u201d \u201cYou know, the ones that do n't show up.

Excited to be part of a team of mean-looking dudes in multicam load-bearing gear, body armor, face masks. I was freshly back from overseas -- I\u2019d been a REMF -- and wanted to feel like a badass. We were assigned to protect a mining claim in northern Wisconsin. This was of course well before the first Water War in the southwest, and the idea of heavily armed private security at a remote mineral extraction site shocked a lot of people. I remember being on the news. Between my tricked-out M4 and padded gloves and the skull facemask, I made newspapers nationwide. Above the fold. Even though the other guys teased me for letting one of the activists take my picture, I remember thinking at the time that the whole thing was fucking awesome. Who were these enviro-weenies who thought they had the right to interfere with a private mining interest on private property? In the end we\u2019d only faced off with a few local protesters. Mostly hippies and Indians as I recall. We didn\u2019t even carry any ammo in those days. But for a wannabe trigger-puller it was a fun summer. I did indeed feel like a badass all kitted up, walking the property perimeter with the team, some of whom were actual combat vets. Something else stuck with me from that summer. One evening I was off-duty and went for a hike along a stream near the mine site. I remember watching a particular stretch of water as the sun set, how the light seemed to climb up out of the trees and how the fish were rising, rhythmically, eating bugs that were on the water and flying around, blinking in and out of the sunbeams. It was silent, peaceful. Like they\u2019d been doing it for a million years. Probably had been. It didn\u2019t register then, but that stream was right downhill from the mine site. A mine site that would eventually be mothballed due to water usage restrictions, be sold off by The Company. Ten years later the neglected tailings dam would fail and dump a million tons of acidic mine waste sludge into the stream, and into Lake Superior. I did see some action with the crew during the first Water War, the southwestern one, but it was mostly defending tanker trucks heading to the frack sites from ambush -- pretty easy stuff, really. Those yahoos had no training and no arms to speak of and we just wiped them out. Didn\u2019t even slow the trucks down, usually. Left them lying in the dust. They were slow, unorganized, predictable. Easy to hit. Wrapped up in cloth from head to foot, just like the hadjis overseas had been. Of course by that time Oklahoma was in full dust-bowl mode, aquifers bone dry, so such dress was practical. But as a child of the War on Terror period I\u2019d be lying if I said it didn\u2019t make pulling the trigger easier. All they had was desperation and desperation is not enough to make a successful guerrilla movement. But they didn\u2019t have to be desperate. They could have moved to the cities or the camps with everyone else and had their water ration. Sure, the ration system was imperfect. If they hated it that much they could have just bought water from The Company. If they could afford it. Any of these would be better than bleeding out in the dust on the side of an empty highway. The Company owned the rights to that water, legal and fair. Who were they to try to take it, based on some romantic ideal of public property? But that was the first war. Not much of a war. Some minor civil unrest. The leeway that the Feds granted The Company as \u201cCritical Infrastructure\u201d meant that they could solve such problems as they saw fit. Fitness, to them, came from the muzzle of a mercenary\u2019s rifle. Like mine. It also meant that I had a full hydration bladder at all times and a hot shower waiting for me in the barracks. I wasn\u2019t complaining. Things settled down for a while. But when the second crisis developed, the fouling of the Lakes due to widespread catastrophic mine failures, we were back at work overnight. The Company had wells up in the Great Lakes sand country and, being the last sources of clean water, they were prime targets for thirsty locals. A couple had already been hit by local guerillas, the crews wiped out, thousands of gallons stolen or spilled. It had been costly to retake them, so the Company sent us up to Michigan to guard this big one until they could bring equipment in to harden it. They told us this well had at one time filled tens of millions of 16-ounce bottles of drinking water, shipped around the country to be sold for a buck a pop. The young guys thought they were joking. But I remember it. I drank those", "'*Motherfucker!'he says before leaping forward with an elbow to attack himself. ...'[ Dave Takamura ] The United States president literally melted through Washington and into the basement of his mansion.

He was sitting on a bench, his hands still in his pocket. He stared at the feet after his hand had stopped dangling on the ankle. Suddenly, he felt something tapping on his shoulder.

People are not able to see when there are a problem. Even when I told you that it was funny the first time I saw someone outside of the darkness. They all looked alike, but I thought I had no. Your monsters. You know, they were light. I started laughing when I saw them on the TV. One night I saw a man with a box and a laser that was going out of his hand. As I saw his image, I began to realize that this guy was better at his dream. There was like I was right. I was just... They had really been gone. I was going to come see my friends soon. They were even more than I was. I could not move their bodies. I was so pretty scared that I stopped. That I was supposed to die. So I stood there and looked at the dark. Then, I saw it. I was starting to realize I was not dead anymore. It was also my bed, because I was floating in that dark. This guy wasn't dead anymore. I was seeing who I was as well. I could not see them either. I looked up and looked at the way my ceiling. I was there, the only body in my dream. I was probably on my head. I was the one with the shaft. I was dead. The house was dark. I was in a dream now. This guy was the one who was sitting in that dream. My girlfriend, I was two years old. We were married and I remember the days we were kissing and I was 12 years old. I remember feeling older than I was when I fell asleep. I remember telling me how I was supposed to die. I said, I'm not sure, but I'm going to die. I really amn't sure.

After a few minutes, a man came in with a clipboard and a clipboard and asked about her. It was a lot, since she was in the hospital's observation room. He asked if she could get the flu shot off the ground and her sister. She said she could, so he went to the nurse's office and wrote down the cause. She waited until she had the cure. The doctors told her that if she was getting the flu shot to die, she needed to have a healthy pregnancy, a healthy family. Otherwise, she would not be able to get the flu shot. Not only that, she would be facing losing her mother. She had been expecting her father, a housewife, to arrive in the next week. There were a lot of people that weren't going to take the time to prepare her for this. When the doctor told her that her little girl would be pregnant, she felt bad. Her little girl was no longer a baby. Her baby girl had been beautiful and happy. But now, she was a bitch. She couldn't give her child to her. She started screaming at the top of her lungs. Her father walked in and told her to stand up. She screamed, and he had tears running down his face. She cried until she collapsed. She had the doctors call her daughter. The hospital nurses called her a sicko. They tried to help her, but they always had to end a life. They would inject her, and inject her after a few days. The doctors told her that a miscarriage was the third time in as many weeks. They didn't want her to live. They tried everything they could to get her to give up. But they never could. There were still treatments that would keep her alive, and she would endure. She cried. She cried so hard and so much that her father came and got her in the hospital room.

Disney Enterprises attempts to position himself as the captain of Disney Life, and Disney acquiesce. *Coined by Jiminy Cricket* Despite the portrayal of extreme parental frustration, children see DiCaprio as an introvert by profession, earning him accolades for pushing Disney to move up the company ladder. At first, he assumes this is because he's sick and suffers from a terminal illness, but eventually he takes steps to improve himself, ultimately adding \u201cTO BE ACKNOWLEDGED\u201d to his resume. ( DiCaprio would quickly become the Captain of DisneyLife; \u201cPut this crap on YouTube!\u201d ) A few years later, and DiCaprio becomes an internationally famous actress, claiming to have met the most beloved character of his career and has become his own reality. He emerges as a fan favorite in multiple movies, and receives his Oscar for his performance in Goldwyn-Mayer. This ends as DiCaprio suffers from an existential crisis, and as the Captain of Disney Life grows more and more frustrated, he begins to take drastic action. In order to get more money out of his employers, he threatens to reveal he is going to have a child, despite his health. *Coined by Jiminy Cricket* Having worked with DiCaprio for a decade, it seems only logical that he becomes an agent of the federal government. On top of this, he denies that his performance in Goldwyn-Mayer has been the product of abuse or deception, implying that it was his own failures that lead him to this predicament. The prevailing theory is that, due to the last thirteen years of his role as the deposed CEO of Disney Life, DiCaprio has become a person of immense influence over his employers, who's budget consists of films only a Hollywood producer can produce, films he doesn't intend to produce, movies he's recently planned to rewrite, and films he intends to draft. DiCaprio tries to expand his influence, attempting to convince his employers to sacrifice his entire future income to get the job, only to realize that", ", and with the right plans.

One day however, he had better ask his master to lend him two wooden sticks, saying it was time he worked.", "The wet marble floor pressed on his cheek like a thousand hands slapping his face frozen in time. Smattering piss of rain ignored his indignant mumblings. His eyes fluttered. Pins and needs ran from finger to shoulder as he pushed back against the floor, contorting his aching body into a cross legged position. Last night was bad. He gathered that. His routine dullness of though crept inwards from the edges of his mind toward the black mist that veiled his most recent memories. He struggled to recall whatever he could n't recall but only for a moment before he decided it probably was n't worth the effort. He glanced around the room for a few minutes before concluding that he probably did n't know where he was. His investigation was n't entirely fruitless, he discovered a mostly full bottle of vodka. It was cheap but would definitely get the job done. Taking a few swigs made it childishly easy to ignore that gigantic black cloud of fog blotting out whatever the hell he did before he woke up. There was a mirror in the room and for want of anything more interesting to study he gazed at himself. It was a game he 'd play with himself, glancing at the mirror and seeing if he could recognize the person looking back. If he did n't know better he 'd have guessed he was a very successful mattress salesman, or perhaps a bum who had managed to score some luck gambling. His face was portly and unshaven, in that limbo place where it had been too many days without being clean and too few days to become a beard. His stomach was round but firm, like a basketball stuffed under a shirt and then semi deflated. The hair was long and unruly, receding far into the past. But his eyes were the giveaway. Looking closely enough at them he could still see an intensity. It was n't the sharp kind he carried in his youth but rather like a rusted dagger. Still sharp enough to cut. \u201cDiCaprio .\u201d The curse rasped out of him in a choke. After all these years spent working on the hallmark channel and tv series based on mediocre movies he was still there. Despite his best efforts to bury himself under all of the alchol and drugs he was still in there. He thought for sure after the bankruptcy he 'd be done, but no that god damned rerelease of Titanic the royalties started pouring in and he could n't get rid of the money. Not even the live action version of the nut job could destroy him. Cursing he hurled the bottle at the mirror but his wet hands slipped and instead of a shattering crash there was only a thud as the bottle bounced off the dry wall and rolled on the floor. His rage thwarted by his impotence he slumped against the floor and finally noticed why there was rain coming into this room. The window was smashed. He looked at the bottle, confused. No, he had n't done that. At least not with the vodka. He looked back at the glass etched around the window sill and his eyes hung on the red that stained the jagged teeth. The headache crept back towards the front of his mind while the bloody glass pinned his eyes in place. What the fuck happened last night?", "Scissors for hands? Hockey masks? Invading dreams?

She was taller than Sam was by about a head, with eyes that matched the sea at dusk and hair the color of the dunes. A gust of wind ruffled her periwinkle dress, blowing a lock of her hair astray. She tucked it away nervously, avoiding his gaze. But Sam had already seen all that he needed to. He had seen it all before, a hundred times over a dozen trips to their little cove. But this time, out of all the times before, he was awake. *The girl in blue* ... He mouthed silently. Her blush deepened, and his own darkened to match once he realized she was watching him closely enough to understand. To his surprise, she smiled. \u201cSam, are you listening ?\u201d His father said, providing a welcome distraction from his thoughts. \u201cThis is Meredith, she 's going to be staying with us for a bit while we 're in town. Now, I know she 's very pretty, but she 's the mayor 's daughter - so try to contain yourself .\u201d \u201cDad !\u201d Sam said, feeling his cheek burn even brighter. Luckily, at that moment the girl extended her hand. \u201cHi. I 'm ... Meredith. Nice to meet you .\u201d She smiled just a bit wider. Sam reached out and took her hand. \u201cHi Meredith. I 'm Sam. And ... I know this is a little bit cheesy, but I think I have seen you in my drea-\u201d Meredith woke up. She rolled over, silencing her second alarm with an almost-casual swat. 10:30. She was going to be late. Panic flooded her system, and before she consciously knew it her feet had hit the wooden floor of her room. She dressed, brushed her hair, and in a flash she was out the door. Today, of all days, she had no time to waste. Three streets down, across a little wooden bridge over a stream, and she was there. A cabin, one of dozens. But this one was special. The door opened, and there he was. Framed in the doorway like it was a portal to another world. Short, but endearing. His face was kind. It was exactly as she remembered it. But this time, out of all the times before, she was awake. \u201cUmmm ... hi .\u201d She stammered.
