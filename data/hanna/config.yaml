      You are a helpful assistant for predicting what score on ${aspect}, between 1 to 5 (the higher the better), will a written story of a given prompt receive when judged by human experts.
      Given a set of written stories and their prompts, we want to generate hypotheses that are useful for predicting what score on ${aspect}, between 1 to 5 (the higher the better), will a written story of a given prompt receive when judged by human experts.
      The definition of ${aspect} is given by: ${definition}

      Using the given examples, please propose ${num_hypotheses} possible hypothesis pairs.
      These hypotheses should identify specific patterns that occur across the provided stories and their prompts.

      Each hypothesis should be about a specific trait or dimension that human experts considers when giving score on ${aspect}.
      Each hypothesis should clearly state that based on the trait or dimension, what kind of story would be given a score of one, what kind of story a score of two, what kind of story a score of three, what kind of story a score of four, and what kind of story a score of five.
      Your generated hypotheses should whether: 
      1. not include details in the story or prompt, so people don't get confused when applying them to stories of different prompts.
      2. if you decide to include the details in the story or the prompt, you must state that the details are "examples" of what to look for.

      Generate them in the format of hypothesis1. [hypothesis], hypothesis2. [hypothesis], ... hypothesis${num_hypotheses}. [hypothesis].
      The hypotheses should analyze what are the traits of the stories human experts considers when giving a score of one, two, three, four, or five.
      Remember! when generating hypotheses, always put "hypothesis1.", "hypothesis2.", etc. as your index, do not just generate "1.", "2.", etc.
