Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said.\n\nMost of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region.\n\nOmar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it.\n\nThe freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said.\n\nOsman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228.\n\nISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year.\n\nThe Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes.\n\nYazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism.\n\nOne of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary.\n\nISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria.\n\nISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year.\n\nReports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives.\n\nAn international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population.\n\nCNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut.

In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time, the private space exploration company  was unsuccessful.\n\nSpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted: \"Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.\"\n\nHe later clarified that the rocket landed, but tipped over.\n\nSpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January, but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded. SpaceX has said it will keep trying and, after it masters landing at sea, hopes to someday land rockets on the ground.\n\nUsually booster rockets burn up in Earth's atmosphere or, like NASA's space shuttle boosters, they fall back into the ocean. So why try to land one?\n\nMusk wants to cut costs. On his company's website, he says that if anyone can figure out how to \"reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.\"\n\nWhat about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon? The smaller, top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds (1,950 kilograms) of supplies, including research equipment and ISSpresso, an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea.\n\nThe space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon. They'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments, trash and other stuff to send back to Earth. When they're done, Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California.\n\nThis is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station. The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station.\n\nTuesday's launch was the second attempt for this mission. Monday's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather.\n\nCNN's Catherine E.
