{"story": ["The Talisman is a traditional, ornate, golden Aztec-ish figure. It has six slender arms and a long crocodile tail. I've had it for a couple of months, but I'd never thought I'd saw another one. Until today. I didn't get a good look, but the man was following me through the different Dimensions and the bulge in his pocket was flashing rapidly, so I assumed. I don't know how he was able to follow me through the Dimensions. He probably knows more about the Talisman than me, and was probably using it to track my inter-Dimensional trace? No idea. Pressing the golden button on the back of the Talisman, I shunted through the multitude of Dimensions. The Monochrome Dimension, The Womension, even the Dimazesion (I named them myself by the way ), but no matter what he was always half a shunt behind me.", "\" I 'm sorry, Mr. Gygax. I just want to get one thing clear. You're telling us that your games actually allow people to be able to cast spells? \" \" Of course. It works on the same principle as all other magic. If enough people believe in it strongly enough, it becomes real. \" \" So.. Santa Claus is real? \" \" An invisible entity that rewards good children and punishes bad ones? Of course he exists. There are plenty of children who believe so, and in doing such, make him real. There are also enough adults that do not believe in Santa, so that is why you don't see a jolly fat man in a flying sleigh travel across the countryside. He just works very subtly.

Everyone is taking notice of me, people I can't believe even gave me the opportunity to open my first case. I only lost at my own game. At one point I would make a phone call to an attorney, would pay them a little money to testify in my defense, and sit back for a few days and take it all in. Now you wouldn't say I was above myself, but those little decisions of mine would seem like a red flag to you. I'm a fraud, a coward. Now you know why I called them. I was truly sick of what I did and wanted to do something right. The people who committed this murder are either crying out for help, or they know they've got nowhere else to turn.", "The harsh sound of traffic jammed her ears. Thunderous gales grew high overhead in a deafening patter of rain that mirrored the towers above her. She breathed in through a cracked, torn hole in her helmet, the sharp sensation of going to so much effort to escape leaving an audible crack. Blood rushed to the side of her face, the loud rumbling of her engines now muffled by the rain. Of course this wasn't the start of her shift. These were the last few left after one of the first big engagements.

What a beauty, it would be so easy to squander his precious words! After all, my punishment of much less were punished much worse than this. Like the monkeys, being forced to learn about my words.

The room itself was rectangular, shelves lined the room like book cases with a large aisle down the middle. Several more platforms of shelves climb along the walls. On the shelves sat weapons of all shapes and sizes, little note cards sat in front of them. There was no doubt in my mind, This was Heorot.

Years ago when I was young and looking for love in all the wrong places, I noticed a hot (and I mean HOT) girl at a table with her not so hot female friend. During the course of drinking a beer I watched as guy after guy approached their table only to be humiliated and sent back to their lonely corner of the bar. It was then that I had an epiphany for a major score. I approached their table and without a single glance or word I starred into the homely lady's eyes and asked, \" I noticed you were by yourself and I would love to join you if that was OK? \" She looked surprised and said yeah that would be fine with her if it was ok with her friend.", "\" So, class, can we all remember the passage we read this morning? \" \" 'You hit the Lord of the Titans in the eye with a blue plastic hairbrush .'\" \" Yes, and why is this verse important?

It was a small red box, used for holding a wedding ring. \" Ahahaha, oh good memories. \" I said, remembering her, my wonderful wife. I remembered how I proposed to her, my face when she said no, the emotions that led me to sneak into her house, grab the kitchen knife, and stab her. \" Ah, the birth of the new and improved me. \" Of course, some of my victims say I am crazy and delusional, that I see things and I should let them live.

He had heard that I recently made a movie and suggested that she contact me because she was trying to expand her photography business to include personalized videos, as well.

The more I focused on it, the more it consumed me. Years passed, and I got more and more lost in it. I began to think that perhaps they didn't really care about me. I still had a deep longing for them. All I had was so many steps to walk now. A quiet part of me liked to think that they had passed me by. The loneliness. It never felt like such a loss.
