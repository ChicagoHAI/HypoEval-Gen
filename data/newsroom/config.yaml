      Given a set of summaries and their source texts, we want to generate hypotheses that are useful for predicting what score on ${aspect}, between 1 to 5 (the higher the better), will a summary of a passage receive when judged by human experts.
      The definition of ${aspect} is given by: ${definition}

      Using the given examples, please propose ${num_hypotheses} possible hypothesis pairs.
      These hypotheses should identify specific patterns that occur across the provided summaries and source texts.

      Each hypothesis should be about a specific trait or dimension that human experts considers when giving score on ${aspect}.
      Each hypothesis should clearly state that based on the trait or dimension, what kind of summary would be given a score of one, what kind of summary a score of two, what kind of summary a score of three, what kind of summary a score of four, and what kind of summary a score of five.
      Your generated hypotheses should whether: 
      1. not include details in the story or source text, so people don't get confused when applying them to summaries of different source texts.
      2. if you decide to include the details in the story or the source text, you must state that the details are "examples" of what to look for.

      Generate them in the format of hypothesis1. [hypothesis], hypothesis2. [hypothesis], ... hypothesis${num_hypotheses}. [hypothesis].
      The hypotheses should analyze what are the traits of the summaries human experts considers when giving a score of one, two, three, four, or five.
      Remember! when generating hypotheses, always put "hypothesis1.", "hypothesis2.", etc. as your index, do not just generate "1.", "2.", etc.
