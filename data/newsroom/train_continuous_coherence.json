This is not going away.</p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.</p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.</p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth&#x27;s surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of &#x27;natural&#x27; climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.</p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It&#x27;s not the heat, it&#x27;s the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.</p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the &quot;second dumbest thing&quot; he has done and be finished with it.</p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.</p><p>That&#x27;s because &quot;nothing&quot; really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren&#x27;t. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn&#x27;t it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don&#x27;t hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.</p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.", "Social gaming isn&#x27;t just a diversion anymore.

Co-workers form teams of five or six and enter a competition in which members earn points by answering online quizzes about healthy foods, taking breaks at work to reduce stress, and meeting weekly goals for eating fruits and vegetables, sleeping, and, of course, exercising. All the activities are shared among participants on a Facebook-like news feed, where teammates and rivals can comment, give verbal pats on the back, or urge each other on.</p><p>Keas charges $12 per user for a year and lets companies personalize the site and choose what rewards, if any, they give to winning teams. &quot;You can change people&#x27;s behavior a little, but you have to make it fun for them,&quot; says Bosworth, who previously ran Google Health, the search giant&#x27;s now defunct effort to create online medical records. &quot;People will fall off the wagon, and that&#x27;s when you need a social mechanism to help them climb back on.&quot;</p><p>World&#x27;s Most Admired Companies: 9 top techs</p><p>Early results are encouraging. Bechtel, the construction giant, deployed Keas as part of a larger wellness initiative. About 8,000 employees in 44 countries signed up, and roughly half reported losing weight over an initial 12-week period. At Progress Software PRGS , of some 600 employees who signed up, two-thirds reported losing some weight, one-third said they were less stressed, and scores said they pared down unhealthy foods. &quot;If you are engaged with others and you have a support mechanism, it is going to have a tremendous impact,&quot; says Joe Andrews, who heads human resources at Progress.</p><p>But experts warn that while promising, health apps like Keas should be put in perspective. &quot;You can change behavior for a short time with just about anything,&quot; says Toni Yancey, professor of public health at UCLA. &quot;Where the pedal hits the metal is in getting people to change behavior for the long term.&quot;</p><p>Despite questions about their overall efficacy, corporate wellness apps are proliferating in part because many investors are betting that the social-gaming wave popularized by Zynga ZNGA can be harnessed to fight obesity. Keas, which has raised $17.5 million from investors, competes with Virgin HealthMiles, part of Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Group, and Red-Brick Health, among others.

The president&#x27;s push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia&#x27;s ambassador to the United States.</p><p>If the United Nations&#x27; watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran&#x27;s suspected weapons program.</p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran&#x27;s central bank \u2014 a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country&#x27;s elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.</p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.</p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do \u2014 as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers&#x27; lists.</p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.</p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, &quot;You don&#x27;t want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.&quot;</p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the &quot;toughest sanctions&quot; for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.</p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.</p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.</p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that &quot;the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and what to do about it.&quot; Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are &quot;fabrications&quot; intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran&#x27;s nuclear centrifuges.</p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it. But it has discussed the evidence widely with allies.</p><p>In part the administration has hesitated to discuss the evidence because, after the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003, any American evidence is considered suspect. Widespread questions about the plot against the Saudis last week underscored how deep those suspicions run.</p><p>But Iran is a different kind of case. Inspectors visit regularly, measuring Iran&#x27;s output of uranium, including recent production of the material, enriched to 20 percent purity, that takes it far closer to the kind of fuel needed for a weapon. Iran said recently that it would produce more of the 20 percent enriched material than it needs for a small medical research reactor, which prompted new concerns that it is building a stockpile that could be converted to weapons use.", "&quot;We don&#x27;t want people coming back or visiting,&quot; Nugent said. The town is still in an &quot;imminent danger of fire,&quot; with several fires still burning nearby. &quot;I can see black smoke behind the courthouse,&quot; she said.</p><p>The fire in Presidio County has grown to 80,000 acres with only 10% containment, the Forest Service said early Monday.</p><p>That growth, according to fire operations chief Mark Sanford, came after the fire &quot;made a 12-mile run on Saturday.&quot; Officials still don&#x27;t know what caused the fast-moving fire, he said.</p><p>Despite the damage, Nugent said things could be much worse. &quot;Tourism is huge&quot; in Fort Davis, she said, but none of the tourist structures have been burned. The downtown and the historic fort buildings are unscathed, she said.</p><p>The blaze, known as the Rock House fire, is currently the largest fire burning in the United States and is just one of 10 fires burning more than 312,000 acres in Texas.</p><p>Another 34 homes have burned in a fire in Midland County that has consumed over 16,500 acres and that the state agency on Sunday described as &quot;very active&quot; and not at all contained, officials said.</p><p>A Red Cross shelter has been set up at Midland College for those displaced or otherwise affected by this wildfire.</p><p>&quot;(Firefighters) can&#x27;t outrun it,&quot; said Alan Craft, a spokesman for the state&#x27;s Lone Star Incident Management Team.</p><p>Another large fire near Swenson has scorched some 103,000 acres in three counties, according to the state Forest Service. Spokeswoman April Saginor said officials believe the Swenson fire has been that large for a couple of days, but were not able to remap it until Monday.</p><p>As of Sunday night, the blaze across parts of Stonewall, Knox and King counties was totally uncontained despite the use of air resources, bulldozers, fire engines and other tools and personnel, a statement from the Forest Service said.</p><p>Official say this fire was caused by a man cutting a pipe.", "If 2014 was the year of the selfie, then 2015 took the art of self-photography to a new and dangerous level.</p><p>People are, quite literally, dying to take a picture of themselves.</p><p>In Russia this year there have been a handful of selfie-related fatalities, including the death of two men in the Ural Mountains who posed for a photo while pulling the pin from a hand grenade.</p><p>And, in June, a university graduate died after trying to take a selfie while hanging from a Moscow bridge.</p><p>Most recently a 17-year-old boy fell to his death from a rooftop as he tried to take his picture for his Instagram page.</p><p>He had previously taken a number of similar pictures of himself posing on high rooftops in the city of Vologda.</p><p>The problem isn&#x27;t just limited to Russia.

He did, however, get permission to climb the statue.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m not a serial selfie-taker - this shot was to publicise my business. It was the shot I knew I had to get because people love selfies,&quot; he told the BBC.</p><p>He admits that the trend towards ever more dangerous selfies is &quot;getting out of control&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Be creative with your pictures but don&#x27;t put yourself in danger,&quot; he advised.</p><p>According to research published by the Ohio State University, the pictures that people post on social media can tell an interesting story about their personality.</p><p>Hundreds of tests on people&#x27;s social media habits were conducted for the study, which showed that people who post a lot of selfies also tend to score higher in traits of narcissism and psychopathy.</p><p>Lead researcher Jesse Fox said that, for many, a dangerous selfie is worth it for the number of likes and comments it will generate.</p><p>&quot;Likes are a quantifiable way of measuring popularity and these days it isn&#x27;t enough to just post a picture of yourself, because everyone is doing that.

It&#x27;s a sci-fi showpiece. It&#x27;s an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It&#x27;s a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It&#x27;s a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It&#x27;s a winged chariot of the Malibu \u00fcber-chic. It&#x27;s a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.</p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.</p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel. Other extreme weight-saving measures, including aluminum wiring and chemically hardened ultrathin glass, keep the weight to 3,267 pounds. The long, light doors swing up and forward. From the front, with doors open, the i8 looks as if it&#x27;s signaling a touchdown.</p><p>The interior is compact yet comfortable, though those over 6-foot-2 may need more legroom, and the rear seats are designed for tiny, limber people.</p><p>Getting in is a challenge. The sill is wide, the seat is low, and there&#x27;s a trick: sit sideways, slide butt in, retract legs. Getting out? Imagine climbing from a bathtub without using your hands.</p><p>Pick a personality with the driving-mode buttons. &quot;Comfort&quot; keeps the car in electric mode to 37 m.p.h., or until you mash the right-side pedal. The eDrive button keeps things electric to 75 m.p.h. or until the battery fades.</p><p>Travel range is about 20 miles in E.V. mode, and recharging takes 1.5 hours at 240 volts or four hours at 120. The Eco-Pro button increases electric efficiency 20 percent by softening the motor response and optimizing climate-control settings. I observed gasoline-powered mileage figures from 27 m.p.g. (impatient cornering) to 37 m.p.g. (safe-and-sane commuting).</p><p>In the city, the i8 feels silent, solid and intuitive \u2014 the excitement happens outside, as gawkers track its progress.</p><p>On Los Angeles&#x27;s well-used freeways, the Comfort setting leaves some comfort to be desired. Even with the variable dampers at full soft, the i8 bobs its nose like Muhammad Ali in the first rounds. High-performance tires come standard in the United States; European versions get narrower wheels and taller tires for lower drag and a smoother ride.</p><p>In Sport mode, the suspension and steering stiffen and the gas engine roars, pops on upshifts and matches revs downshifting into corners. It sounds great, and it should: much of what you hear is a prerecorded soundtrack piped through the sound system.</p><p>The i8 feels strong at full power, but the head-snapping response expected from a partly electric powertrain is absent. The i8 takes time to gather itself, with an atavistic vestige of turbo lag.</p><p>On the intestinal twists of Mulholland Highway the i8 can be driven with brutal abandon. The brakes are strong, the chassis is as stiff as a bank vault, and there&#x27;s enough power to reach the next corner presently. BMW claims a 0-to-60 time of 4.2 seconds, and top speed is 155 m.p.h.</p><p>The front tires push when going hard into corners, but everything sticks coming out. Even with the stability control off, the i8 resists spinning its tires \u2014 the software ghost is still there, lurking in the machine.</p><p>The i8 is complicated and imperfect. A car that will be used for emissions-free commuting should allow people to get in and get out. It rides harshly. The exterior design is too clever \u2014 the layered rear deck whispers &quot;Your trunk is open.&quot;</p><p>Still, if the i8 represents the future of sports cars, things are looking bright.</p><p>A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2014, on page AU4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Future Will See You Now.

Pole-sitter and defending race winner Helio Castroneves was fifth-fastest (224.573), two spots below Team Penske teammate Will Power (224.993) but five higher than Ryan Briscoe (223.493).</p><p>Temperatures reached the 90s during the morning practice, with no incidents reported. With similar conditions are forecast for Sunday, drivers came away feeling good having a solid weather baseline for setting up the car.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know if the speeds (on Sunday) will be quite that high, but we might have to run that pace,&quot; Franchitti said. &quot;A lot depends on the car keeping its balance and grip with the (changing) weather.&quot;</p><p>The practice also gave drivers a chance to try out the push-to-pass button, which will make its Brickyard debut. The feature, which provides 18 seconds of extra horsepower, can be used 15 times during the race.</p><p>Franchitti seemed to like it, though he probably won&#x27;t need it as much as one of the race favorites. But he expects it to figure in down the stretch because that&#x27;s when most drivers will save their allotment for.</p><p>&quot;You&#x27;ve got to know how to use it at the start and on restarts, but you want to save some for the end,&quot; he said.</p><p>Most drivers remained consistent with their practice times, though some of the higher qualifiers were slower than expected in the heat. Graham Rahal, who will start seventh in Rahal Letterman Racing&#x27;s No. 30 car, bottomed out the speed charts at 219.998 mph.</p><p>In contrast, Tony Kanaan ended preparations on a high note after a wreck-filled weekend of qualifying that will see him start at the rear of the 33-car grid. He was 20th fastest in Andretti Autosport&#x27;s No. 11 entry.</p><p>E.J. Viso posted his best speed this month (224.419 mph), good enough for sixth.</p><p>&quot;The last few weeks have been really tough,&quot; said Viso, who starts 19th. &quot;Now we have a fast and comfortable race setup. This is basically because of all the hard work of my mechanics and engineers.?After having a big crash last week, this is a great way to recover and hopefully we will have a great race on Sunday.&quot;</p><p>Power ended the month with the top practice speed (227.646 mph) set on Sunday. Alex Tagliani was second a 227.513 mph with Castroneves third at 227.136 mph.</p><p>Tracy to race for home team: Canadian Paul Tracy missed out on racing at Indy but will return to the Izod IndyCar Series on July 25 for the Honda Indy Edmonton street course race. Team Oh Canada announced Friday that he and fellow Canadian Alex Tagliani will be teammates for the event to be run at the City Centre Airport.</p><p>Pit notes: Helio Castroneves&#x27; team won the Pit Stop Competition after Hideki Mutoh&#x27;s car stalled in the final. \u2026Wade Cunningham won the Firestone Freedom 100 Indy Lights Series race, leading a race-high 38 laps and passing Charlie Kimball with six laps left for the victory.

Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time: 154 mins. Rated R: Gory violence, incest theme. 3 1/2 Stars.</p><p>If there&#x27;s a soft spot in your heart for the sword-&amp;-sandal epic - and from the star rating above, I think you can guess where I stand - then you&#x27;ll swoon with giddy delight over &quot;Gladiator,&quot; a sweaty, stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of &quot;Ben-Hur,&quot; &quot;Spartacus&quot; and the so recently departed Steve Reeves.</p><p>From his biceps to his gluteus, Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasn&#x27;t a shred of humor, but then, he doesn&#x27;t have time for idle nonsense when he&#x27;s lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature, like the mark of Zorro.)</p><p>In director Ridley Scott&#x27;s thrilling, burnished epic, Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesn&#x27;t want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs.</p><p>The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for &quot;The Insider,&quot; he&#x27;s no gym-toned pretty boy. He&#x27;s solid, beefy, rough-hewn, creaking along in his heavy leather costume, with a look on his puss of weary disdain.</p><p>What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty: &quot;What we do in life echoes in eternity!&quot; Anyway, it can&#x27;t be his hygiene, although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow.</p><p>After a coup by the emperor&#x27;s weak-kneed son, Commodus (a whiny, surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus&#x27; fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers, two shows daily, in Rome&#x27;s Colosseum, the entertainment complex of its day.</p><p>Crowe, like his character, must grimly come to terms with the fact that, actor or gladiator, it&#x27;s all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants, either at the multiplex or in the arena, and you can write your own ticket.</p><p>&quot;I have power only to amuse the mob,&quot; he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater.</p><p>The plot, about avenging honor, provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; they&#x27;re subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage, with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre, yes, this is a good thing.</p><p>Connie Nielsen plays Commodus&#x27; sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics, you know). Nielsen&#x27;s costumes are laced up like bondage gear, and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past.</p><p>But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering! The seething! The hooded gaze! The quiet suffering! (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic! No disinfectant!)</p><p>The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries, all of them thinkers, including Derek Jacobi (&quot;I, Claudius&quot;) as a senator, Djimon Hounsou (&quot;Amistad&quot;) as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed, who died with two days to go on the shoot, looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur.</p><p>Reed&#x27;s character is the one most in touch with the movie&#x27;s premise - that entertainment is the goal, and a worthy one at that.", "The White House tried Sunday to win support for President Obama&#x27;s forthcoming budget, arguing the plan is a balanced approach to economic prosperity and warning Republicans about stonewalling negotiations and pushing a &quot;rejected&quot; Romney plan.</p><p>&quot;Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,&quot; senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot; &quot;Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to \u2026 essentially enact the Romney economic plan.

At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of &quot;excusing rape on college campuses&quot; and saying &quot;&#x27;no&#x27; means &#x27;yes&#x27; if you know how to spot it.&quot; The way Limbaugh &amp; Co. see things, that&#x27;s an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:</p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that &#x27;no&#x27; means &#x27;yes&#x27; if you know how to spot it? I&#x27;m probably \u2014 let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that&#x27;s not tolerated. People aren&#x27;t even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out &#x27;why.&#x27; Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?</p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh&#x27;s status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, &quot;What do I have to demonstrate because he&#x27;s a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don&#x27;t even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,&quot; she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh&#x27;s remarks.</p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh&#x27;s claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying &quot;You can&#x27;t maliciously attack people,&quot; Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh&#x27;s 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a &quot;slut,&quot; a &quot;prostitute&quot; and many other things.</p><p>The Washington Post&#x27;s Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh&#x27;s fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:</p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.</p><p>Here&#x27;s the thing: She didn&#x27;t. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.</p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his &quot;word choices.&quot;</p><p>Limbaugh &amp; Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: &quot;We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,&quot; she told Hannity.</p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: &quot;You know what, it&#x27;s a serious issue, because I think you&#x27;re right,&quot; Hannity said. &quot;And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It&#x27;s going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts. I think they&#x27;re going to be surprised.&quot;</p><p>Erik Wemple writes the Erik Wemple blog, where he reports and opines on media organizations of all sorts.", "Now that Newt Gingrich has vaulted into the lead in the Republican presidential stakes, he&#x27;s going to be seeing a lot more of this:</p><p>Calling it the &quot;dumbest thing&quot; he has done in recent years isn&#x27;t enough. This is not going away.</p><p>But, Newt can turn his pas-de-deux on the loveseat with Nancy into an opportunity to promote a consistent and electable political message.</p><p>Because he will be asked about this at every turn, Newt will have the air time and the opportunity to tell the truth on climate change\u2014based upon real science\u2014and to interface it with a limited-government philosophy. The two are easy to do.</p><p>Start with the obvious. Instead of waffling on the subject, he could just point out that earth&#x27;s surface temperature is about 1\u00b0C warmer than it was a century ago. There were two periods of warming, the first from about 1910 through 1945, and the second from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. They were both roughly the same magnitude. Because the first one was long before we put the majority of fossil carbon into the atmosphere, Newt can say\u2014with scientific authority\u2014that the magnitude of &#x27;natural&#x27; climate change is likely to be at least as large as what humans have done.</p><p>Then Newt should proceed to the future. It&#x27;s not the heat, it&#x27;s the sensitivity. How much it will warm in the future is a function of how sensitive the atmosphere is to doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of independent arguments now coming together showing that this value may have been overestimated. The reference for the most recent is a November issue of Science.</p><p>Next, a little refreshing honesty: in 2009, the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill (which the Senate did not) commanding that the average american\u201438 years from now\u2014be allowed the carbon dioxide emissions of the average citizen in 1867. Prior to its passage, Newt was undeniably for such a system. Newt could call that that the &quot;second dumbest thing&quot; he has done and be finished with it.</p><p>After setting the record straight, how about interjecting his own political philosophy? When asked what to do about global warming, he should give the honest answer: if the atmosphere indeed is not as sensitive to carbon dioxide changes as previously thought, the correct response is nothing.</p><p>That&#x27;s because &quot;nothing&quot; really means something. Newt should channel his historian. When markets are free, capital supports innovation more efficiently than when they aren&#x27;t. Think about the remarkable changes in energy and technology in the last 100 years. Isn&#x27;t it rather obvious that the same will occur in the next century, if only we don&#x27;t hinder capital development? Newt might even use the catchy saw (first sloganed by Northern Illinois Gas in 1972) the future belongs to the efficient, and that there are impressive market forces that advantage those who produce things efficiently or produce efficient things.</p><p>When the doomsayers say Newt is believing in a Deus ex machine to dramatically cut carbon dioxide emissions, he might point out that those were the same folks who, only a very few years ago, told us we were running out of natural gas. Innovation and capital revolutionized drilling and fracturing shale, and we now know we have literally hundreds of years of it under our feet. There are a lot more voters and delegates around the country who will benefit from the shale revolution than there are in ethanol-addicted Iowa.", "The White House tried Sunday to win support for President Obama&#x27;s forthcoming budget, arguing the plan is a balanced approach to economic prosperity and warning Republicans about stonewalling negotiations and pushing a &quot;rejected&quot; Romney plan.</p><p>&quot;Right now, the approach of many Republicans, particularly the leadership in the House, is my way or the highway,&quot; senior White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer told &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot; &quot;Their view is the only acceptable plan is to try to \u2026 essentially enact the Romney economic plan.

At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of &quot;excusing rape on college campuses&quot; and saying &quot;&#x27;no&#x27; means &#x27;yes&#x27; if you know how to spot it.&quot; The way Limbaugh &amp; Co. see things, that&#x27;s an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:</p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that &#x27;no&#x27; means &#x27;yes&#x27; if you know how to spot it? I&#x27;m probably \u2014 let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that&#x27;s not tolerated. People aren&#x27;t even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out &#x27;why.&#x27; Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?</p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh&#x27;s status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, &quot;What do I have to demonstrate because he&#x27;s a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don&#x27;t even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,&quot; she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh&#x27;s remarks.</p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh&#x27;s claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying &quot;You can&#x27;t maliciously attack people,&quot; Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh&#x27;s 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a &quot;slut,&quot; a &quot;prostitute&quot; and many other things.</p><p>The Washington Post&#x27;s Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh&#x27;s fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:</p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.</p><p>Here&#x27;s the thing: She didn&#x27;t. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.</p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his &quot;word choices.&quot;</p><p>Limbaugh &amp; Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: &quot;We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,&quot; she told Hannity.</p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: &quot;You know what, it&#x27;s a serious issue, because I think you&#x27;re right,&quot; Hannity said. &quot;And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It&#x27;s going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts. I think they&#x27;re going to be surprised.&quot;</p><p>Erik Wemple writes the Erik Wemple blog, where he reports and opines on media organizations of all sorts.", "The tech giant was forced to discontinue the model after worldwide reports of exploding phones</p><p>SAUMSUNG has announced it will scrap its Galaxy Note 7 model after worldwide reports of exploding phones, as thousands of frustrated owners wonder if they are entitled to a refund.</p><p>Earlier today the company took the extraordinary step of asking owners of the \u00a3750 handset to immediately turn their phone off because of fears the device may catch fire.</p><p>Customers have been left in the lurch by Samsung, who have so far declined to give details on whether they will be refunding customers.</p><p>But consumer experts Which have reassured Galaxy 7 owners they will be covered as Samsung has admitted the fault.</p><p>The South Korean tech giant had already said it would halt in sales and production of the model while it investigated reports of phones exploding.</p><p>And a Samsung spokeswoman this morning confirmed the company &quot;has permanently discontinued the production of Galaxy Note 7\u2033, hours after billions of dollars were wiped off the tech firm&#x27;s stock market value.</p><p>For customers who have already shelled out hundreds of pounds on the device, worries will be less about Samsung&#x27;s share price and more about their consumer rights.</p><p>Last month the tech firm announced an &quot;exchange programme&quot; for customers in the UK and Ireland who had already purchased the phone, after reports of the device&#x27;s lithium-ion battery catching fire.</p><p>Offering the replacement handsets, Samsung said it was &quot;fully confident the battery issue had been fully resolved&quot;.</p><p>But there continued to be reports worldwide of exploding phones, terrifying owners.</p><p>In the company&#x27;s home country, South Korea, a Burger King diner had their meal interrupted when their replacement Galaxy Note 7 burst into flames in dramatic scenes later uploaded to YouTube.</p><p>Airlines have also been warning travellers to switch off their phones while flying.</p><p>Hopes of a straightforward product recall for UK consumers appeared to be dashed after Royal Mail and ParcelForce refused to ship the device, even if they are being returned to Samsung.</p><p>Samsung&#x27;s spokeswoman this morning was unable to confirm what plans were in place for reimbursing customers affected by the exploding phone debacle.</p><p>But according to consumer rights experts at Which.co.uk, customers who bought the Galaxy Note 7 should be entitled to a refund, because Samsung has recognised an issue with the model.</p><p>Those who have pre-ordered the handset from a UK retailer are able to cancel the order and get a refund at any time up to 14 days after the phone is delivered.</p><p>In a statement this morning, Samsung advised Galaxy Note 7 owners to &quot;power down and stop using the device and take advantage of the remedies available&quot;.</p><p>Any owners concerned about their phone should phone Samsung on 0330 726 7864.</p><p>We pay for your stories!

Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. &quot;Our was not the highest,&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.&quot;</p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.</p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood. They would be within walking distance to a park and two libraries with story time for children.</p><p>&quot;We were trying to look at homes where we can walk to the Metro, or bike to the city or to the Metro,&quot; said Stephanie, 27.</p><p>Sears and Montgomery Ward kit houses: Cherrydale, once abundant with cherry orchards, is a family neighborhood dating to 1893. While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens&#x27; Association newsletter.</p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.</p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.</p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens&#x27; Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.</p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck &amp; Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.</p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.</p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own &quot;welcome wagon,&quot; Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.</p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.</p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines.

For many channels, but especially for Esquire, which is trying to avoid being dismissed as Lifetime for men, alcohol is the badge of belonging, a liquid demonstration of youthful hipness, New Age machismo, and of being a &quot;dude&quot; or a &quot;bro&quot; or, as a South African canoe champion says on &quot;Boundless,&quot; using the preferred local term, a &quot;bru&quot; (which,as it happens, rhymes with brew).</p><p>A few women are allowed in the club.

After Charlie Sheen left &quot;Two and a Half Men,&quot; on CBS, the creator killed off his hard-drinking character. (That may have been too cold turkey: this season, the writers introduced his daughter, who seems to have inherited some of her father&#x27;s bad habits.)</p><p>The restraint is relative, and not necessarily a sign that a Puritan revival is spreading across networks. The message that drinking and driving don&#x27;t mix has sunk in, certainly, but mostly, alcohol jokes seem old hat, and writers prefer the once taboo subjects of marijuana and masturbation.</p><p>The Esquire Network has to compete with more established cable brands like Bravo and Discovery. Esquire magazine, of course, has a well-established identity, but even it is often defined by what it&#x27;s not: Playboy without the centerfolds, The New Yorker without the writers.</p><p>Most of Esquire&#x27;s television fare offers tamer escapism than hit series like &quot;The Deadliest Catch.&quot; And it is far less gonzo than almost anything on Vice, a magazine with a YouTube offshoot that is sometimes carried by HBO and offers off-kilter documentaries about places like North Korea.</p><p>On Esquire, drinking is the bond that assures viewers that, however fit, disciplined and refined, its heroes are still very much the lads. (Also, some of the top sponsors include Jose Cuervo and Grey Goose vodka.)</p><p>The hosts of &quot;Boundless,&quot; two Canadian endurance athletes, Simon Donato and Turbo Trebilcock, go to literally marathon lengths to gin up the gin, even in remote and unboozy locations like Angkor Wat in Cambodia. There, they enter a six-day, 230-kilometer marathon, and even in that unendurably hot and humid climate, amid chanting Buddhist monks, there is drinking. A German competitor guzzles a beer at every aid station, though most of the hard-core consumption is committed by a merry group of Indian runners who like to party.</p><p>&quot;Guess we needed a couple more whiskeys before we started,&quot; one of them, Manoj, says roguishly after a so-so running time on Day 1.</p><p>&quot;Brew Dogs&quot; doesn&#x27;t need to work as hard to press the point.

(The Proclaimers&#x27; song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot; isn&#x27;t their theme song, but it should be.)</p><p>Perhaps because there is nothing quite as tedious as a man describing the nuanced notes of hops, the Scots go to macho extremes, including brewing a Colonial-style ale with corn, molasses and elements distilled from a copy of the Declaration of Independence, while atop a float in a Fourth of July parade in Pottstown, Pa. (They also coax a young woman fresh from yoga class to sip their doughnut-flavored beer while doing the downward dog.)</p><p>Ilan Hall, a chef and the host of &quot;Knife Fight,&quot; describes his series as &quot;a bare-knuckled boxing show of a cooking competition&quot; that pits chefs against each other in an &quot;after-hours war zone.&quot; (He wears a camouflage flak jacket instead of an apron.)</p><p>And sure enough, on this cooking show, eating well is an excuse to drink heavily.</p><p>As a rowdy crowd cheers them on, rival chefs drink shots and fiercely whip up delicacies like braised goat ribs with yogurt and pomegranate.

Kaepernick also threw his final pass to Crabtree, a 38-yard game-winner on a play that wasn&#x27;t designed for San Francisco&#x27;s No. 1 wide receiver.</p><p>In his past three games, Crabtree has 23 catches for 301 yards and two touchdowns with 90-plus receiving yards in each game. Prior to his streak, he had 90-plus receiving yards in five of the first 53 games of his four-year career.</p><p>In his five starts, Kaepernick has a 113.6 rating when targeting Crabtree, who has helped earn his confidence with reliable hands. According to Pro Football Focus, Crabtree has three drops in Kaepernick&#x27;s starts, an impressive figure given the heat the Howitzer-armed quarterback puts on his throws.</p><p>On KNBR Tuesday, Harbaugh, who famously declared in the offseason Crabtree had the best hands he&#x27;d ever seen, crowed a bit when asked if there was a special Kaepernick-Crabtree chemistry.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, I think there is,&quot; Harbaugh said. &quot;But Michael has been doing this all year now.

Boy, the evidence sure is there.&quot;</p><p>With at least 10 catches and 132 yards over the final two regular-season games, Crabtree (73 catches, 868 yards) would become the 49ers&#x27; first 1,000-yard receiver since Terrell Owens in 2003 and will have the most receptions since Owens hauled in 100 in 2002.</p><p>Davis, who had team-highs in targets (eight), receptions (six) and yards (83) in Kaepernick&#x27;s first start against Chicago last month, has since become an afterthought. He had one catch for 10 yards against the Patriots, and four catches, 29 yards and nine targets over the last four games.</p><p>Davis said he&#x27;s yet to establish a chemistry with Kaepernick that matches the connection he had with former starter Alex Smith.</p><p>&quot;You have to develop that chemistry, that bond so you can be on the same page,&quot; Davis said. &quot;That&#x27;s something me and Kaep don&#x27;t have right now.

They are not close, the Russian and the American, whom she has not managed to beat since 2004, when she prevailed in the final at Wimbledon, aged 17.</p><p>For an hour or so on Tuesday, however, the schadenfreude resided with the chastened world No1 back in Miami, as the lean-limbed young Spanish upstart looked like adding Sharapova to her short but impressive hit list of celebrity take-downs.</p><p>She was poised to embarrass the faltering seventh seed after a first-set blitz of powerful, confident hitting from all angles, but the grind got to her. Sharapova, as she has done now in her past 18 three-setters on clay (and 25 of 26 overall), was too strong of mind and body over the longer distance, taking a tick over two hours to win 1-6, 7-5, 6-1.</p><p>So the tournament gets the glamour semi-final it craved: Sharapova, thrashed by Williams in last year&#x27;s final, against the rising Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who had a marginally tougher time of it on Court Suzanne Lenglen. She held off the spirited challenge of another Spaniard, the 14th seed Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro, to win 7-6, 2-6, 7-5 in two hours and 22 minutes, and bootleg seats on Court Philippe Chatrier for their match on Thursday will sell like those along the catwalk in Milan.</p><p>Muguruza, in her first slam quarter-final and with nothing to lose, came close to securing a footnote in the game&#x27;s history as the first player to beat both Sharapova and Williams in the same slam. However, Muguruza&#x27;s tennis disintegrated into shards of overcooked groundstrokes as the fist-pumping diva at the other end again dipped into her considerable reserves of determination.</p><p>On Lenglen shortly afterwards, Bouchard hit a double fault on match point but repaired the damage with a stunning cross-court backhand and tried again. As with Muguruza, Su\u00e1rez Navarro left the stage with a limp, netted backhand, struck single-handedly. Both are interesting players with big games. If they are to break through when it matters, though, they will have to cope with the added pressure of expectation. Bouchard has taken just 10 games off Sharapova in 30, baggage that will be hard to carry into the first semi-final. But, like Muguruza, she has nothing to lose.</p><p>Sharapova had difficulty later understanding a tweet by Andy Murray&#x27;s mother, Judy, and swore she had no idea who she was. The tweet was simple and clever \u2013 &quot;Sharapova is like a tea bag. Put her into hot water, and ul find out how strong she is&quot; \u2013 but the player looked nonplussed.</p><p>And when Sharapova was reminded of a photo of her with Bouchard as a young girl, currently hitting the airwaves on Twitter, she struggled to recall the moment. &quot;My first memory? Probably when she was playing the juniors. I don&#x27;t know how many years that was ago. I think when she received a wildcard into a tournament in Canada.&quot; Sharapova does tennis. She is not big on jokes and sentiment.</p><p>The women nevertheless outshone the men on day 10, although Ernests Gulbis sustained his eye-catching run with a stylish, serve-led demolition of Tomas Berdych that will give the world No2 Novak Djokovic plenty to ponder before their semi-final on Thursday.</p><p>On a buzzing Lenglen court, Gulbis, by a little way the most intriguing figure in the men&#x27;s game, with talent to back his candour, allowed himself a lightbulb smile when Berdych stuck his closing effort into the netting.</p><p>Coming off the best result of his wayward career \u2013 over Roger Federer in five sets on Sunday \u2013 he showed he had plenty left in his some times unreliable legs to win 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, in three minutes less than it took Sharapova to beat Muguruza. won his match 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, but Djokovic made much harder work of beating Milos Raonic, who fought hard all the way to the end of the first two sets then launched a late fightback from 1-5 in the third before the Serb closed it out on his own serve, 7-5, 7-6, 6-4.</p><p>It might well have sounded absurd to say Gulbis would be a credible challenger for this title after he lost his first set of the tournament, 4-6 against the world No63 Lukasz Kubot.

Within two days on the market, however, there were 10 offers. &quot;Our was not the highest,&quot; Stephanie said. &quot;We wrote a letter to the owners about why we liked the house.&quot;</p><p>The letter, along with a photograph of the family, worked. What drew the Stahlbergs to the house were the solar panels and the trees and bushes \u2014 raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, grapes, apples, plums and currants \u2014 growing organically on the property. The Stahlbergs also envisioned finishing the basement bedroom and bathroom for an au pair.</p><p>They also fell in love with the neighborhood.

While many neighbors have lived in the area for as long as 60 years, newcomers move in and out these days, said Kathryn Holt Springston, who worked for the Smithsonian American History Tours Office as an educational specialist and historian for 28 years. She also served as curator and director of the Arlington Historical Museum and editor of the Cherrydale Citizens&#x27; Association newsletter.</p><p>Single-family homes, the Arlington public schools, access to bike trails and proximity to the District draw people to the neighborhood. Sometimes, though, they move in but stay only a few years. Finding a house in Cherrydale can involve the competitive process the Stahlbergs experienced.</p><p>About half a mile north of the Virginia Square and Ballston Metro stations on the Orange and Silver lines, Cherrydale has a variety of residences ranging from farmhouses to bungalows to Sears and Montgomery Ward kit homes with two to five or bedrooms or sometimes more. Many date from 1900 to 1930, though some of the older houses were purchased to be torn down and replaced with larger homes, including some built as recently as this year.</p><p>Living there: Cherrydale lies north of Interstate 66 and south of Lorcom Lane, stretching roughly from Utah Street on the west to the northward-curving interstate on the east. The Maywood neighborhood claims the eastern half of those boundaries north of Lee Highway, lending something of an arrowhead shape to Cherrydale. Since 1908, the Cherrydale Citizens&#x27; Association has planned activities and resolved neighborhood concerns. In the 1970s and 1980s, people often referred to the neighborhood as Mayberry, according to Springston, 63. In 1948, her parents bought the house where she lives with her husband and son. It dates to 1890, Springston said.</p><p>In the neighborhood, 49 properties sold in the past year, according to Billy Buck, an associate broker at Buck &amp; Associates. The lowest priced was a one-bedroom, one-bath condominium for $200,000; the highest priced was a five-bedroom, five-bath farmhouse at $1.63 million. Twelve properties are on the market now, ranging from a one-bedroom, two-bath condo for $274,900 to a new five-bedroom, five-bath Craftsman house at $1.799 million.</p><p>Welcome wagon: The five-points intersection \u2014 Lee Highway, Old Dominion Drive, Quincy Street, Military Road and Quebec Street \u2014 is dotted with at least two car dealerships and other commercial establishments while nearby is a Safeway and the Cherrydale Hardware, which opened in 1938.</p><p>The Cherrydale Volunteer Fire House, built in 1919, is home to such events as the annual spaghetti dinner, concerts and for 90 years each December there is a visit from Santa Claus for children under 12. Other community events are the annual Fourth of July party and picnic at 21st and Stafford streets. A neighborhood with its own &quot;welcome wagon,&quot; Cherrydale has approximately 1,400 households and three parks as well as the Martha Custis Trail for biking, running and walking.</p><p>Schools: Glebe Elementary, Taylor Elementary, Swanson Middle, Kenmore Middle and Washington-Lee High.</p><p>Transit: The neighborhood is close to the Virginia Square or Ballston Metro stops on the Orange and Silver lines.

Ms. Temple said the longer Mr. Akin waited, the more difficult it would get.</p><p>The first deadline for Mr. Akin to have easily withdrawn from the race was Tuesday evening. His decision to stay in the race means that he now has only a few weeks to reconsider before things get even harder.</p><p>Certification of the presidential ballots in Missouri will be no later than Sept. 17, and could be shortly after President Obama officially accepts the Democratic nomination on Sept. 5.</p><p>Once the ballots are printed, any candidate who seeks to withdraw must pay for the reprinting of new ballots. That could be prohibitively expensive for Mr. Akin, but presumably the Republican Party \u2014 which badly wants him to withdraw \u2014 would cover the cost.</p><p>Military overseas ballots begin shipping out Sept. 22. That might be the first firm deadline. But the drop-dead deadline is Sept. 25, when general absentee ballots are sent out.</p><p>Mel Carnahan, the former Missouri governor and Ms. Carnahan&#x27;s father, died on Oct. 16, 2000, during his campaign for the Senate against the Republican incumbent, John Ashcroft. Mr. Carnahan&#x27;s name nonetheless appeared on the ballot in November \u2014 and he won. (His widow, Jean, was appointed to the seat, and lost it in special election in 2002.)</p><p>Assuming that Mr. Akin bows to pressure from Republican leaders (or simply concludes that he isn&#x27;t able to raise enough money to mount a credible campaign), Missouri law requires that he seek a court order allowing him to drop out of the race.</p><p>State officials say that issuing such court orders is routine. Mr. Akin would merely have to file the necessary papers with the court and his name would no longer be printed on the November ballot. Republicans could then quickly nominate someone else to run against Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent.</p><p>Democrats would no doubt like to see Mr. Akin \u2014 now politically weakened by his comments on rape and pregnancy \u2014 stay in the race. In theory, the Democratic officials who run the state&#x27;s election offices could object to Mr. Akin&#x27;s request for a court order, a move that would force a hearing before a judge.</p><p>The relevant statute says someone like Mr. Akin can withdraw &quot;pursuant to a court order, which, except for good cause shown by the election authority in opposition thereto, shall be freely given upon application by the candidate to the circuit court in the county of such candidate&#x27;s residence.&quot;</p><p>Election officials say they can find no precedent at all for such an objection in the state&#x27;s history. But Ms. Carnahan is herself a factor in Republican minds. As the Democratic Senate nominee in 2010, she lost to Representative Roy Blunt, and Republicans imagine she could put up a fight.</p><p>&quot;The secretary&#x27;s job is to protect the rights of Missouri voters,&quot; Ms. Temple said when asked whether Ms. Carnahan would fight a court order to remove Mr. Akin&#x27;s name from the ballot.</p><p>A further complication: Under state law, any election authority in Missouri can oppose a withdrawal order, down to the county and city level, and there are Democrats aplenty in Missouri. But Ms. Temple added that right now, it would be up to a Missouri court to determine whether Mr. Akin could withdraw, not the secretary of state.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s completely in the hands of the court to decide the facts,&quot; she said.</p><p>Assuming Mr. Akin does manage to drop out, the state central committee of the Republican Party in Missouri would have to pick a new candidate within 28 days, or by Oct. 12, whichever comes first.", "Jess Quinn is training for a 10km race.

The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States&#x27; roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.</p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues \u2013 a quirk of language known as a &quot;proprietary eponym&quot;. The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being &quot;Tased&quot; or &quot;Tasered&quot;.</p><p>The word Taser, though, didn&#x27;t start with the company: it&#x27;s actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.</p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it&#x27;s told \u2013 a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth \u2013 belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.</p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle \u2013 a totally novel idea in 1911 \u2013 and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.</p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. &quot;Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn&#x27;t do in the dark continent!&quot;</p><p>&quot;With the price of ivory soaring,&quot; says Swift&#x27;s veteran hunting companion, &quot;there&#x27;s a chance for us all to get a lot of money.&quot;</p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.</p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice&#x27;s March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown&#x27;s death.</p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as &quot;hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks&quot;, and as &quot;wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes&quot;.</p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more &quot;civilized&quot; white outsiders.</p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown&#x27;s killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of &quot;animals&quot; in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.</p><p>&quot;White police officers wouldn&#x27;t be there if you weren&#x27;t killing each other,&quot; former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift&#x27;s rank paternalism, he later added: &quot;I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.&quot;</p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons \u2013 particularly the electric rifle \u2013 to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.</p><p>&quot;Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,&quot; the novel reads.</p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn&#x27;t make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that \u2013 and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.</p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.</p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which &quot;civilized&quot; whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn&#x27;t meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.", "I think there&#x27;s a real possibility that there&#x27;s going to be a substantial realignment in the political scene in this country, especially if nothing is done to satisfy these dissatisfied people.</p><p>The Trump phenomenon is really a reflection of what happened in the referendum, to some extent, and so is Podemos and so is Syriza and so is the Front National in France.</p><p>Unless the western world can somehow or other satisfy large numbers of its people that it can run the economy and the country in a way which is in their interests, I think you are going to finish up with this discontent.</p><p>If we are going to save liberal democracy, it&#x27;s very important that something is done to get it back on track again.", "A French teenager who was infected with HIV as a baby and given intensive drug therapy in early childhood has lived for more than 12 years without any treatment, raising hopes among scientists searching for a cure for Aids.</p><p>The case of the 18-year-old was presented at an Aids conference in Vancouver, Canada, by doctors at the Institut Pasteur who treated her. Like the so-called Mississippi baby, she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the first weeks of her life.</p><p>Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs. The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson. Doctors talked in terms of a &quot;functional cure&quot;, because the child had no detectable virus.</p><p>However, the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child&#x27;s body. HIV scientists confessed to disappointment, although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case.</p><p>This time there is more caution. It is the first case of long-term remission in a child, say the French team, but they accept that it may not be permanent.</p><p>The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for six weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection, but to no avail. Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped, tests showed the infant had a high viral load and she was put on a cocktail of three antiretroviral medicines, which is the standard treatment for HIV.</p><p>When the girl was six years old, the family decided to stop the drugs and for six months doctors did not have contact with her. But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable \u2013 although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.</p><p>There are people known as &quot;elite controllers&quot; whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n, of the HIV, inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those. &quot;Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.&quot;</p><p>That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body&#x27;s immune system defences.</p><p>S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the two remaining, one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.</p><p>She has a healthy life with no complications, but this girl is not cured. We&#x27;re talking about remission</p><p>&quot;She is doing perfectly well,&quot; said S\u00e1ez-Ciri\u00f3n. &quot;She has a healthy life with no complications.&quot; But he added: &quot;Very clearly this girl is not cured. We&#x27;re talking about remission.&quot;</p><p>The case was presented at the eighth International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV pathogenesis, treatment and prevention. Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: &quot;We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure \u2026 the child received medication early after birth. We don&#x27;t know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication. About 1% of people can do that.&quot;</p><p>Lewin, a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure, said trials were needed. It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Itwas possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.</p><p>&quot;The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop,&quot; she said. &quot;These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment. They are going to be really informative.&quot;"], "label": [2.0, 3.6666666666666665, 5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.333333333333333, 3.3333333333333335, 3.3333333333333335, 2.6666666666666665, 3.6666666666666665, 3.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.3333333333333335, 3.3333333333333335, 4.333333333333333, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0, 4.0, 4.333333333333333, 3.0, 2.6666666666666665, 2.3333333333333335, 3.6666666666666665, 2.6666666666666665, 4.333333333333333, 4.0, 4.333333333333333, 3.0]}
