Time and again, many cognitive accounts appeal to the idea of plausibility without specifying its cognitive basis. Most of these accounts are grounded in operational definitions of plausibility, such as, for example, the plausibility ratings that people give to some set of stimuli.

In remembering-notably, when verbatim memory has faded-plausibility is used by people as an efficient strategy in place of more costly direct retrieval from long-term memory (Lemaire & Fayol, 1995; Reder, 1979 Reder, , 1982;; Reder & Ross, 1983; Reder, Wible, & Martin, 1986) . In reading, people have been shown to use plausibility as a cognitive shortcut to speed parsing and resolve ambiguities (Pickering & Traxler, 1998; Speer & Clifton, 1998; Traxler & Pickering, 1996) . In everyday thinking, plausible reasoning that uses prior knowledge in flexible ways appears to be commonplace (Collins & Michalski, 1989) . In inductive inference, Smith, Shafir, and Osherson (1993) have shown that plausibility plays a role when familiar topics are used; that is, reasoning from the particular (e.g., poodles can bite through wire) to the general (e.g., dogs can bite through wire) depends on how plausible one finds the premise in question. In creative word combinations, Costello and Keane (2000, 2001) have argued that plausibility plays a fundamental role in constraining the interpretations produced for novel noun-noun compounds (e.g., banana car, skunk squirrel) . Although these studies have demonstrated the pervasiveness of plausibility, most of them have not provided any theoretical account of its basis. Typically, they have defined plausibility operationally in terms of plausibility ratings, often using the term plausible inter-What plausibly affects plausibility? Concept coherence and distributional word coherence as factors influencing plausibility judgments LOUISE CONNELL and MARK T. KEANE University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland Our goal was to investigate the basis of human plausibility judgments. Previous research had suggested that plausibility is affected by two factors: concept coherence (the inferences made between parts of a discourse) and word coherence (the distributional properties of the words used). In two experiments, participants were asked to rate the plausibility of sentence pairs describing events. In the first, we manipulated concept coherence by using different inference types to link the sentences in a pair (e.g., causal or temporal). In the second, we manipulated word coherence by using latent semantic analysis, so two sentence pairs describing the same event had different distributional properties. The results showed that inference type affects plausibility; sentence pairs linked by causal inferences were rated highest, followed by attributal, temporal, and unrelated inferences. The distributional manipulations had no reliable effect on plausibility ratings. We conclude that the processes involved in rating plausibility are based on evaluating concept coherence, not word coherence.",

This view holds that when people make plausibility judgments, they relate some stated target description to their prior experience, make the invited inferences in the statement, and somehow assess whether the result is a good match to what they have experienced in the past, either directly or vicariously. For example, if someone is asked to assess the plausibility of the statement The bottle rolled off the shelf and smashed on the floor, he or she might make the inference that the bottle rolling off the shelf caused it to smash on the floor. Then he or she might consider this elaborated description to be highly plausible because past experience has suggested that falling fragile things often end up breaking when they hit floors. In short, the description has a certain conceptual coherence. In contrast, if the target description was The bottle rolled off the shelf and melted on the floor, a causal inference could be made, but the statement seems less plausible because past experience has few cases of falling fragile objects melting on contact with floors (although a scenario can be constructed in which this could occur, such as if the room was made of metal and heated up like an oven).

If sensible stories were used but their conceptual coherence somehow varied, would differences in plausibilityjudgments follow? Second, do all inferences have equal effects on plausibility judgments? Black et al. did not distinguish between different types of connecting relations-for example, do inferences based on attributal relations (part of, attribute of, or made of ), as opposed to causal relations, differentially affect plausibility?

In these analyses, a given word's relationship to every other word is represented by a contextual distribution. The contextual distribution of a word is formed by moving through the corpus and counting the frequency with which it appears with other words in its surrounding context. Thus, every word may be summarized as a vector-or point in high-dimensional space-showing the frequency with which it is associated with other lexemes in the corpus. In a similar way, a whole sentence may be represented as a single point in distributional space by merging its word points; for example, the latent semantic analysis (LSA) model (Landauer & Dumais, 1997) uses the weighted sum of constituent word vectors to denote tracts of text. In this way, two sentences containing words that occur in similar linguistic contexts (i.e., that are distributionally similar) will be positioned closer together in this space than two sentences containing words that do not share as much distributional information. For example, LSA expresses this distributional similarity as a score from [21, 11] , where high scores between words reflect a large amount of shared distributional information and the mean score for randomly chosen word pairs is .02 (Kintsch, 2001) . This type of distributional information 1 has been implicated in many cognitive phenomena, including the prediction of priming effects (Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Lund, Burgess, & Atchley, 1995) , context effects on typicality (Connell & Ramscar, 2001 ), children's acquisition of syntactic categories (Redington, Chater, & Finch, 1998) , synonym selection (Landauer & Dumais, 1997) , and metaphor interpretation (Kintsch, 2001) .",

For example, strong tea is highly plausible, whereas powerful tea is not, and tea is more distributionally similar to strong than to powerful. However, as in the case of concept coherence, this work raises more questions than it answers. First, do these effects generalize beyond very simple descriptions (like adjective-noun pairs)? Would they also hold for whole sentences? Second, is distributional information sufficient in itself to explain plausibility? Could it, for instance, remove the need for an explanation based on conceptual coherence? Third, if the word coherence account does not supplant the concept coherence one, do the two types of coherence combine to influence plausibility?

These descriptions are much more complex than adjective-noun pairs and, therefore, allow us to test the generality of word distribution effects. Their complexity also allows us to examine more subtle effects of conceptual coherence-that is, whether different classes of inferences impact plausibility differentially (note that we include both coreference and bridging inferences [Haviland & Clark, 1974] in our definition of inference). For example, the description The bottle fell off the shelf/The bottle smashed should invite a causal inference, whereas The bottle fell off the shelf/ The bottle was pretty should invite the inference that the bottle in the f irst sentence has the attribute pretty. Finally, since both word coherence and concept coherence can be varied in these descriptions, we can explore the effects of both factors on plausibility.",

Four distinct categories of sentence pairs were used: causal, attributal, temporal, and unrelated. From a purely concept coherence viewpoint, we see plausibility as being about the fit between a given scenario and prior knowledge. This fit is influenced by many different factors, including the nature of the inferences made, the number of inferences made, the length of the inferential chains constructed, the amount of conjecture in the inference, the existence of possible alternative inferences, and so on (see Connell & Keane, 2003 , for a computational model of such specific factors). For the explanatory purposes of this experiment, we can gloss these diverse factors as the strength of the inferential connection between the two sentences. Broadly speaking, if the scenario described in the two sentences is strongly connected, as determined by prior knowledge, the scenario will appear more plausible. In contrast, if the scenario described in the two sentences is weakly connected, the scenario will appear less plausible. This simple explanatory model allows us to make certain predictions for the four conditions in this experiment; specifically, we can predict a decreasing trend in perceived plausibility, with the following ordering: causal . attributal . temporal . unrelated (see Table 1 for sample materials).

In this respect, the causal and the attributal conditions are very strongly connected, in that a single inference connects both sentences. For example, in our causal scenario in Table 1 , a single causal inference is found, using prior knowledge, to link the bottle's falling to its breaking. Also, in our attributal scenario, a simple referential inference is made to establish prettiness as a property of the falling bottle. On the other hand, the temporal and the unrelated conditions are less strongly connected, because they require many inferences to be made. For example, to establish the inference in our temporal scenario, one needs to construct the conditions under which the bottle might come to sparkle after it fell (e.g., its falling into a beam of sunlight, or a light passing across it on the floor). In our unrelated scenario, the two sentences have an even weaker connection, since they can be connected only by many interdependent inferences and the assumption of many additional conditions-for example, The glass melted. unrelated one could assume that the room had a metal floor, that the floor had been heated to a very high temperature, and that when the falling bottle made contact with the floor, it melted. Indeed, the weakest connection of allnamely, when no connection can be found-is likely to occur in this unrelated condition when people fail to make the inferential leaps required. Such additional conditions do not need to be established in the causal condition, since the falling of fragile objects is known to lead typically to their smashing. Nor do these conditions need to be established in the attributal condition, where the direct assertion of a property of the bottle is noted as a simple putative fact.

The strength of the connection between the two sentences and, hence, its perceived plausibility are greatest in the causal pairs, where a single direct informative inference can be made. The connection strength and, hence, plausibility are lowest in the unrelated pairs, where extensive inferences and assumptions have to be made to form the connection (which, indeed, may fail to be formed at all). Ranged in between are the attributal and the temporal pairs, distinguishedlargely by the amount of inferencing and additional conditions that need to be assumed. In reality, the sources of these effects are much more complex than is given credit in this simple explanatory model. Connell and Keane (2003) have developed a computational simulation of these results in which the conditions are distinguished by many different knowledge variables.

No reliable interaction It could be argued that the failure to find a reliable effect of distributional strength was due to a poor rendering of the difference between the strong and the weak distributional pairs. Some strong-weak materials were further apart than others in terms of their distributional strength (i.e., their LSA scores). However, recall that our pretests of the materials showed that the two conditions were reliably different in distributionalstrength. Moreover, regression analysis showed that the size of this difference between the strong-weak variants had little effect on the differences in plausibility ratings that were provided by the participants (adjusted r 2 5 2.003, p . .7).",

The results confirmed our earlier findings that there was no significant difference between strong and weak sentence pairs, with distributional strength failing to achieve significance even in the group with the most extreme LSA score differences [least extreme F 1 (1, 21) This analysis was just one of many we carried out. None of these analyses showed any obvious grouping of the materials set along the strongweak dimension that generated robust differences in plausibility ratings.",

This early experiment had an identical procedure but differed in that participants saw either the strong or the weak variant of each sentence pair, rather than both being printed together on the same page. The use of the strong/weak variant for each sentence pair was counterbalanced in the experiment, and the order of presentation of the materials was randomized for each participant. This experiment, which involved 24 student participants, showed no effect of distributional strength [strong M 5 6.6, weak M 5 6.7; F 1 (1,21) 5 0.03, MS e 5 10.593, p . .8; F 2 (1,30) 5 0.04, MS e 5 7.865, p . .8]. Upon dividing the materials into the same extreme groups outlined above, our reanalyses of this earlier experiment also confirmed that there was no significant effect of distributional strength to be found [least extreme group, strong M 5 7.0, weak M 5 7.1; F 1 (1,21) 5 0.07, MS e 5 10.579, p . .7; F 2 (1,12) 5 0.13, MS e 5 4.859, p . .7; mid-extreme group, strong M 5 6.7, weak M 5 6.9; F 1 (1, 21) In conclusion, the present experiment replicated the concept coherence effect found in Experiment 1 but showed no reliable effect of word coherence. The results of further analyses verified that even the largest distributional strength manipulations do not reliably affect plausibility ratings. As such, we believe that it is safe to conclude that word coherence has no reliable effect on the judged plausibility of event descriptions. In short, the effects found by Lapata et al. (1999) for adjective-noun pairs do not generalize to more complex discourse.",

                "text": "There are two novel f indings in the work reported here. First, we have established not only that concept coherence plays a role in plausibility, but also that different types of inference have different effects on plausibility: Sentences with no obvious inferential link between them are rated as barely plausible, with temporal, attributal, and causal inferences ranged in increasing plausi- bility. Second, we have shown that word coherence does not appear to play a role in the rating of plausibility. How can we relate these findings to those in the previous literature, and what constraints do they generate for future research into plausibility? Some parallels may be drawn between word and concept coherence as described in this article and the local and global context models of discourse comprehension. Local context models propose that words act individually or in combination to affect subsequent words (e.g., by priming; see Duffy, Henderson, & Morris, 1989) . These local context effects are alignable with word coherence and can be seen as the product of distributional knowledge; the distributional information activated in the vicinity of one word may include the subsequently presented word. Indeed, models of distributional knowledge have already been shown to predict priming effects (Landauer & Dumais, 1997; Lund et al., 1995) . In contrast, global context models propose that processing is facilitated by ongoing discourse representations above the word level (Hess, Foss, & Carroll, 1995) . These global context effects are alignable with concept coherence and can be seen as the product of conceptual knowledge; the conceptual model built around a description may prime related information. In support, it has been shown that priming effects do result from conceptual discourse models (Hess et al., 1995) and that these discourse models include knowledge drawn in by causal inferences, as well as information given in the description (Halldorson & Singer, 2002) .",

(1986) have shown that varying the number of possible inferences that could be drawn between sentences in a story has an effect on plausibility judgments. We have demonstrated that it is not only the number, but also the type of inference that is important to plausibility. Causal inferences are found to be the most plausible because they provide the strongest concept coherence. Then, in decreasing order of concept coherence and, thus, plausibility are attributal, temporal, and unrelated (i.e., no relation at all) inferences. This f inding emphasizes that plausibility is affected not just by the presence of inferences, but also by the type of inference in question. In other words, it is not just the presence of global context that is important to plausibility, but the actual knowledge drawn in as each of the inferences is made. Connell and Keane (2003) used this principle in their computational model of plausibility. Each particular inference type draws in different elements and levels of world knowledge, which allows the model to calculate concept coherence (and therefore, plausibility) by analyzing the resulting representation.",

Lapata et al. gave their participants simple adjective-noun pairs, which by their nature provide local, but not global, contexts. It has been proposed by Hess et al. (1995) that a local context is useful only when people are given no global context, which would suggest that Lapata et al.'s participants based their plausibility ratings on the only thing they had-the distributional information of the local context. This represents a simple situation in which word coherence is the sole basis of the plausibility rating. In contrast, our materials consisted of two sentences that required an inference to connect them, providing a global context on which to base a plausibility assessment. In this case, concept coherence is the basis of the plausibilityrating, and no reliable effect of word coherence is found, because word coherence is rendered somewhat irrelevant by concept coherence.",

In their conceptual combination work, Lynott and Ramscar (2001) suggested that distributional information can aid the interpretation of noun-noun compounds by constraining meaning to a property-or relation-based interpretation, while having no effect on the processes that identify the details of the interpretation itself. Similarly, distributional information could aid sentence comprehension, while having no effect on the processes that establish inferences (see Burgess, Livesay, & Lund, 1998) . Burgess et al. argued that although distributional information cannot in any way be used to make inferences, it can provide some of the necessary constraints by offering thematic cues to situation goals and word semantics. This would suggest that word coherence may contribute to the early stages of plausibility judgment but that the effect is not discernible once concept coherence comes into play.",

Planned pairwise compar-isons revealed that all of the conditions were reliably different from one another, using Bonferroni adjustments ( ps , .05). No effect of noun type was found [F 1(1,19)  5 0.83, MS e 5 4.827, p . .3; F 2 (1,44) 5 0.29, MS e 5 7.471, p . .5].

As was predicted, the order of inference types (causal . attributal . temporal . unrelated) was found to be reliable, using Page's trend test by participants [L(40) 5 1,147, p , .0001] and by items [L(12) 5 341.5, p , .0001].",
