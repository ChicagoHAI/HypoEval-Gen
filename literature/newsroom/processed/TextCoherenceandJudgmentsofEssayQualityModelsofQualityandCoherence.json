This is reflected in the literature about writing as well as textbooks that teach students how to write. Until recently, there were few studies that had empirically investigated the role of cohesion cues in essays. However, studies by McNamara, Crossley, and McCarthy (2010) and Crossley and McNamara (in press ) have found no evidence that cohesion cues and essay quality are related. McNamara et al. (2010) found no differences between high and low proficiency essays according to indices of cohesion. In contrast, indices related to language sophistication did show significant differences between the groups. Crossley and McNamara (2010) also found that linguistic sophistication characterized essays rated as higher quality. In addition they found that an index related to text cohesion (aspect repetition) correlated negatively with human scores of essay quality indicating that more cohesive essays were rated as lower quality.",

This analysis permitted an examination of relations between holistic essay scores and analytic factors to determine the importance of these features in predicting essay quality. They found that human judgments of text coherence were the most informative predictor of human judgments of essay quality, explaining 65% of the variance. Crossley and McNamara (2010) also examined links between the cohesive devices reported by Coh-Metrix (e.g., semantic coreference, causal cohesion, spatial cohesion, temporal cohesion, connectives and logical operators, anaphoric resolution, word overlap) and human judgments of coherence. Among these variables, only one index (subordinating conjunctions) demonstrated positive, significant correlations with the human ratings of coherence; however, this index also had strong links to syntactic complexity. The majority of the cohesion indices correlated negatively to the human ratings, indicating an inverse relation between the selected cohesion variables and the human judgments of coherence. Thus, while the Crossley and McNamara (2010) study indicated that human ratings of coherence were important indicators of holistic evaluations of essay proficiency, how human raters construct a coherent mental representation did not correlate with the cohesive devices provided by Coh-Metrix.",

Our primary goal is to better understand which judgments of individual text features best explain judgments of overall text quality. Like Crossley and McNamara, we are specifically interested in text features related to coherence. However, we improve upon this earlier study by analyzing a larger corpus of essays collected under conditions that better represent high stakes testing. Also, unlike the Crossley & McNamara study, which suffered from low agreement between raters on many of the analytical text features, we use a different set of text features that better represent the organizational and rhetorical characteristics of essays. Using such features, we hope to increase inter-rater reliability between our expert raters and thus provide stronger links to the underlying cognitive construct of interest (i.e., coherence).",

Such an environment better represents high stakes testing (i.e., SAT writing tests). Two SAT prompts were used and students were randomly assigned one prompt to which they responded. All students were native speakers of English and were in either Composition One or Composition Two course (i.e., freshmen composition). In total, 315 students wrote one essay each.

The rubric was used in the composition program at MSU to evaluate writer proficiency. Minor changes in the rubric were made by trained cognitive scientists and the director of the composition program at MSU to ensure that the construct of interest (coherence) was adequately assessed. The analytic rubric was then subjected to usability tests by expert raters with at least three years experience in essay scoring. The final version of the rubric had four subsections: introduction, body, conclusion, and correctness. The introduction subsection contained questions related to the use of an effective lead, clear purpose, and clear plan. The body subsection addressed the use of topic sentences, paragraph transitions, clear organization, and essay unity. The conclusion subsection included judgments on the strength of summarization and conviction. The correctness subsection identified the proper use of grammar, syntax, and mechanics. Two of these analytic features (Organization and Unity) evaluated semantic based, global cohesion (i.e., structural elements that promote overall comprehension) and thus were classified as measures of text coherence. One of these features (Paragraph Transitions) evaluated explicit cuebased, local cohesion and was classified as a measure of cohesion. A holistic grading scale based on a standardized rubric commonly used in assessing Scholastic Achievement Test (SAT) essays was also included in the rating rubric. This holistic scale was the same scale used by McNamara et al. (2010) and Crossley and McNamara (2010) . The holistic scale and all of the rubric items had a minimum score of 1 and a maximum score of 6. The analytic rubric ratings included the following:",

We hypothesized that an analytic score representing text coherence would explain the most variance in the holistic scores based on the findings of Crossley and McNamara (2010) . We used a training set to generate a model to examine the amount of variance explained by each analytical score. The model was then applied to a test set to calculate the accuracy of the analysis. Accordingly, we randomly divided the corpus into two sets: a training set (n = 209) and a test set (n = 106). The training set was used to identify which of the analytic scores most highly correlated with the holistic scores assigned to the essays. These analytic scores were later used to predict the holistic scores in the training and test sets using the generated model. We controlled the number of variables included in the regression analysis in order to reduce the likelihood that the model was over-fitted. If too many variables are used, the model fits not only the signal of the predictors, but also the unwanted noise. The model may, thus, lack accuracy when applied to a new data set. We selected a ratio of 20 observations to 1 predictor, which is standard for analyses of this kind. Given that the training set comprised 209 essays, we determined that we could include 20 features in our regression analysis.",

The strongest predictor of coherence was the number of types in the text, which overlaps conceptually with word length. Thus, more words in a text likely permit the development of greater representations of text coherence. Our second predictor of coherence was LSA middle to final paragraphs, which demonstrated that the semantic similarity between the body of middle paragraphs and the final paragraph helps develops coherent mental representations. Because a wellwritten final paragraph also summarizes the plan presented in the introduction and is the last section read, we argue that links between the evidence present in the body paragraphs and the summarization of this evidence in the conclusion affords greater text coherence in the mind of the reader. Our next three predictors of coherence were all related to linguistic sophistication. Coherent texts have more complex verb forms (i.e., inflected or infinitive forms), less frequent words, and a greater diversity of words. The finding likely demonstrates that text coherence for expert raters is a product of linguistic features related to overall writing quality that are more difficult to process and thus force the reader to attend to the text. Our last predictor of coherence was the number of paragraphs with more paragraphs (i.e., greater structure) leading to more coherent texts.",
