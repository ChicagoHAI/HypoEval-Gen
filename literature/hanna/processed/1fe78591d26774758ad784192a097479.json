    "abstract": "This exploratory study investigated the effects of prompts on students' writing performance and critical thinking. Two groups of Chinese undergraduates (n = 129) responded to two distinct prompts with differing rhetorical functions and objects of enquiry. The comparison group responded to a conventional prompt modelled after prompts in high-stakes English tests which tend to converge over narrow ranges, while the experimental group responded to a prompt with problem-solving as the main rhetorical function, and behavioral economics as the object of enquiry. Various differences were noted between the two sets of essays related to standardized indexes of writing quality, as well as other rhetorical and linguistic features including: use of metadiscourse, essay organization, and use of certain lexical items. The comparison group outperformed the experimental one in several aspects of writing. However, the experimental group generated more diverse language and displayed enhanced critical thinking. We argue that the washback of high-stakes tests may result in a better performance in some respects in students' responses to conventional prompts. However, this may also reflect a cookie-cutter response to such prompts that arrives at the expense of a whole range of ignored rhetorical functions and objects of enquiry, some of which may stimulate increased critical thinking.",

                "text": "Writing prompts are essential elements in both the assessment and pedagogy of English writing (Crusan, 2010; Weigle, 2002) . They have thus become the focus of investigation in recent years. Rhetorical functions and objects of enquiry are two of the key variables when analyzing a writing prompt. Rhetorical function refers to the discoursal purpose of the written response required by a prompt, e.g., evaluation, recommendation or explanation, while object of enquiry refers to the topic of the expected response. (Example prompts from past high-stakes tests are listed in Table 1 to illustrate the two terms). The literature indicates that both the rhetorical function and object of enquiry of a writing prompt may have significant effects on linguistic and rhetorical features within a response as well as the overall quality of students' writing (e.g., He & Shi, 2012; Hinkel, 2009; Lee & Anderson, 2007) . However, to date few studies have investigated prompt effects on students' critical thinking despite the close interaction between critical thinking and writing. Critical thinking is defined as a set of cognitive abilities and thinking dispositions (Facione, 2015; Halpern, 2003) 1 which are primarily embodied in people's language (oral or written arguments) (Palmer, 2012; Ramage, Bean, & Johnson, 2010) . And according to Flower and Hayes (1981) ; MacArthur and Graham (2016) and many other researchers, the writing process involves intensive cognitive activities. These cognitive abilities (critical thinking) and cognitive activities (writing process) eventually manifest themselves in a writer's rhetoric. On the theoretical and empirical basis stated above, we think that by analyzing the linguistic and rhetorical features in students' essays, we would be able to investigate their critical thinking.",

Green (2006) , for instance, observed that a considerable amount of time in the writing classroom was spent on practicing prompts conforming to the IELTS (a high-stakes English test) standards. As such, appropriate writing assessment can be used to induce intended educational purposes, such as cultivating critical thinking abilities or other essential skills in students. However, studies (Liu & Stapleton, 2015; Moore & Morton, 2005) show that both rhetorical function and object of enquiry in the writing prompts of high-stakes tests may converge over narrow ranges. Specifically, rhetorical function tends to require evaluation or hortation (strong appeal or recommendation) and object of enquiry tends to be sociocultural in nature. Moore and Morton (2005) claim that such writing prompts emphasize the \"spontaneous expression of opinion\" (p. 64), and might bring about formulaic structures and limited sets of expressions and ideas in students' responses. In addition, such prompts may cause corresponding washback in the writing classroom, i.e., teachers may emphasize the practice of certain types of writing over others.",

The study is meant to provide possible directions towards cultivating critical thinking in the English writing classroom. The comparison group responded to a conventional writing prompt; in other words, the prompt was similar to those found in high-stakes English tests. The experimental group responded to a prompt whose object of enquiry and rhetorical function was quite unlike those found in conventional prompts. First, the object of enquiry was in an area other than education, technology or social issues, i.e., the usual areas covered in high-stakes tests. Second, the rhetorical function required more analyzing and problem-solving instead of the usual evaluation and hortation. Scripts were collected and changed into electronic data. Both corpus and content analysis were performed on the data to compare and uncover patterns.",

Yu (2010) , for example, by examining the correlation between the object of enquiry and the lexical diversity in test-takers' essays, found that lexical diversity is higher in testtakers' responses to impersonal topics. Hinkel (1995 Hinkel ( , 2009) ) found that students' language use when responding to particular writing prompts is dependent on their cultural and personal background, and topic knowledge. In light of these findings, Hinkel (2009) proposed that the use of new objects of enquiry in prompts that are less proximate to test-takers' own experience and opinions may lead to richer linguistic variety. Since language use reflects one's critical thinking (Palmer, 2012 ), Hinkel's recommendation (2009) has given impetus to the design of this research project, specifically, the need to explore the possible influence of writing prompts with distinct objects of enquiry on students' written argumentation and critical thinking.",

Stapleton Assessing Writing 38 (2018) 10-20 when responding to the C/C prompts than for the G prompts, while they used significantly longer words and significantly more pronouns for the G prompts. However, when responding to the two types of prompts, student writers' syntax did not change. In an earlier study, Durst (1987) investigated the text structures and other linguistic features in the analytical and summary writing of students to compare the writing processes employed by the students in both types of essays. It was found that students used more varied and complex thinking skills in analytical writing. The author, therefore, suggested the use of analytical writing as a heuristic for critical thinking. Durst (1987) study provided additional evidence of the effect of rhetorical function (in that study, analysis vs. summary) on linguistic and rhetorical features of students' writing. Another significant implication of Durst's study (1987) to the present one is the discussion of the connection between rhetorical function and critical thinking via examining linguistic features of student essays. It has been found that there is a tendency for the rhetorical functions of writing prompts on high-stakes tests to converge, especially when compared with university writing assignments for content subjects. In one study, Moore and Morton (2005) compared IELTS writing prompts with a corpus of writing prompts used in two Australian universities. They examined four elements in the two sets of prompts, namely, genre, information source, rhetorical function and object of enquiry. The study revealed very important differences between the writing prompts of IELTS and those used in university. Specifically, university assignments covered a wider range of rhetorical functions including evaluation (67%), description (49%), summarization (35%), comparison (35%) and explanation (28%), while IELTS prompts were mainly restricted to evaluation (100%) and hortation (70%). They also identified distinct features of IELTS prompts regarding object of enquiry. Notably, they found that despite seemingly diverse categories, IELTS prompts focused on \"the responsibilities of certain authorities [that are] closely connected to the rhetorical function of hortation\" (p. 63). These findings to some extent inspire further investigation into the narrow range of rhetorical functions and objects of enquiry in writing prompts along with the impact this might have on the writing classroom.",

It was found that evaluation and hortation were the two most common rhetorical functions. As for object of enquiry, notable similarities were found among the three tests with three themes of a sociocultural natureeducation, technology and social issuesdominating. These findings thus draw attention to the impact that writing assessment may be having on English writing pedagogy; in particular, there is a concern that writing instruction may be confined to a narrow range of rhetorical functions and objects of enquiry leading to a constricted way of writing and even reasoning. For instance, due to the tendency of prompt uniformity in high-stakes tests, memorized templates may be misused or overused in some writing classrooms to prepare for the tests. As a result, students' writing may involve less original thought and personalized rhetoric than it potentially could.",

Green (2006) , for example, in order to explore the washback of the academic writing section of IELTS, investigated the relationship between writing test design features and pedagogical practices by observing the behavior of 197 learners and 20 teachers over 51 classroom hours. He found that IELTS prompts featured: 1) impersonal topics, 2) a limited range in terms of rhetorical function, and 3) expected responses based on personal opinions. To examine how washback of the IELTS writing prompt predicted classroom activities, Green (2006) compared the writing-focused IELTS preparation classes with English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classes at U.K. universities. Classroom observation data showed that 58% and 48% of the time in IELTS preparation classes and in EAP classes respectively was spent practicing impersonal topics conforming to the IELTS standards. In addition, topics of study were comparable in both IELTS and EAP classes. Most notably, little time was spent on personal topics or academic topics in either IELTS preparation classes or EAP classes, although these topics were discussed in more depth in some EAP classes. Evidence in Green's study suggests there was considerable washback of IELTS writing tasks on writing pedagogy conducted in the classes he viewed.",

                "text": "Critical thinking, a key component of higher-order thinking, is defined as both a set of cognitive abilities and thinking dispositions. Critical thinking abilities refer to skills of interpretation, analysis, inference, evaluation, explanation, self-regulation, and problem-solving, etc., and a person with critical thinking dispositions would be apt to use these skills (Facione, 2015; Halpern, 2003) . Because critical thinking development is often stated as a primary goal in syllabi for students at various levels worldwide, numerous endeavours have been made towards the cultivation of students' critical thinking in classroom teaching. However, few studies have focused on the potential of using assessment for enhancing critical thinking. While in a more general sense, Alderson and Wall (1993) argue that \"tests are held to be powerful determiners of what happens in the classroom\" (p. 115), Eckstein and Noah (1993) more specifically contend that one crucial function of tests is to \"[encourage] higher levels of competence and knowledge\" (p.11). If the active engagement of critical thinking is included in language tests, teachers and learners are more likely to include practice to this end. Following this line of thought, Shirkhani and Fahim (2011) propose that English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners' critical thinking abilities be enhanced through assessment practice by outlining some specific suggestions for test designers and English language teachers. And although there is the concern about simply adding another dimension to \"teaching to the test,\" If we use tests with clarified instructional targets, teachers can focus their classroom efforts on getting students to master what they're supposed to learn\" (Popham, 2001, p. 20) .",

Another is Carroll's study (2007) , which examined the \"intellectual changes in student writing\" (p. 216) during a critical thinking course; these intellectual changes were investigated by measuring differences in varied linguistic variables and cognitive variables. The studies by Condon and Kelly-Riley (2004) and Carroll (2007) suggest that critical thinking can be evaluated in student writing by noting the use of language. Thus, language can be an indicator of critical thinking (Carroll, 2004; Palmer, 2012) . A critical thinker knows the \"power of loaded language\" (Carroll, 2004, p. 29 ), e.g., hedges (Hyland, 2005) , or words with emotive content (Carroll, 2004) . And in turn, the use of the loaded language indicates the critical thinking of a person. A critical thinker knows how to use words for persuading others to accept ideas or values. She can use expressions such as \"I think\", \"I feel\" to indicate that the ideas expressed are personal opinions rather than facts, and use hedges such as \"might\" to reduce the strengths of a claim. Although differences in the content of writing prompts can induce variation in students' written language, which in turn reflects their critical thinking competence, to date few empirical studies have been conducted to explore the possibility of enhanced critical thinking competence through the use of different writing prompts.",

We chose this field because of its rich focus on both intuition and logic, as well as its potential for creative and critical thinking. For example, in the prompt below, students need to explain the logic behind a counterintuitive occurrence. Here, one could argue that economics is a specialized field unsuitable for a writing prompt; however, the same could be said for socio-cultural prompts that stray into sociology, technology and education, equally specialized fields.

In effect, in devising a new kind of prompt, the goal was to explore the type of language and organization the participants used in order to see if it differed from the comparison group.

This meant that some children and teachers had to wait, causing stress for both. In order to try to solve this problem, two economists offered their help. They created a plan that charged parents a 20 RMB penalty each time they arrived later than ten minutes after 4 o'clock. This penalty was added to the parents' monthly fee of 1500 RMB. Soon after the new system started, however, a strange thing happened. The number of late pick-ups actually increased. In the end, the number of parents arriving late more than doubled. Instead of improving the situation, the economists' plan made things worse. 3 Explain why you think the plan had the reverse effect and how you would change it. You will be allowed 35 min.

All the data were then converted to electronic text to facilitate data analysis, resulting in two corpora of over 30,000 words, with the experimental corpus being 14,874 words and the comparison corpus 15,596 words. In view of the exploratory and open-ended nature of the research question, we adopted a data-driven approach with an aim to trace meaningful differences in both sets of responses to the two prompts. Data analysis comprised two phases. In the first phase, preliminary text analysis was performed via an automated text analyzer for general linguistic features of the data, and then further text analysis was conducted for syntactic complexity, lexical diversity and word frequency which are considered proxies for the most predictive linguistic elements of argumentative writing quality (Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011; Lu, 2011; McNamara, Crossley, & McCarthy, 2010) . Specifically, McNamara et al. (2010) claim that higher quality essays are likely to be characterized by having \"more complex sentences, a greater diversity of words, and less frequent words\" (p.63). Although researchers tend to agree that syntactic complexity, lexical diversity and word frequency are indicators of writing quality, there are various measures for each of these indicators. In this study, following McNamara et al. (2010) , and using the computer program Coh-Metrix 3.0, the syntactic complexity was measured by the number of words before the main verb; lexical diversity was measured by the Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity (MTLD) which has been found to be a reliable index of a writer's vocabulary and indicative of linguistic skills (McNamara et al., 2010) ; word frequency was measured by Celex (log frequency of all words).",

We analyzed the use of metadiscourse in students' scripts for a better understanding of the linguistic features in writing. According to Hyland (2005) , metadiscourse is a key element of discourse analysis since it provides \"insights into patterns of interaction and engagement\" and reveals \"how writers, through their texts, see the values, interests and assumptions of their communities\" (p.195). Following Crismore, Markkanen, and Steffensen, (1993) and Hyland (2005) , two categories of metadiscourse were coded: textual metadiscourse and interpersonal metadiscourse. Under the textual metadiscourse category, we focused on three subcategories: transition markers, frame markers and code glosses. Under the interpersonal categories, two subcategories were coded: hedges and attitude markers. These five subcategories were chosen because the initial coding indicated that these were the most frequent. Table 2 illustrates the coding scheme for metadiscourse use in both the experimental and comparison group essays. The first author coded the metadiscourse in all the scripts (N = 129). A second coder, with a master's degree in applied linguistic with an appropriate research background, coded 50% of the scripts. The inter-rater reliability, calculated with Cohen's kappa, was 0.85, 0.89, 0.90, 0.87, and 0.81 for transition markers, frame markers, code glosses, hedges, and attitude markers respectively. Disagreements were then resolved through discussion. Upon completing the coding of metadiscourse use and data entry, descriptive statistics were generated; then independent sample T-tests were performed to compare the use of the five subcategories of metadiscourse between the two groups.",

In the conclusion, the stance was restated to a greater or lesser extent. For the experimental group, however, the three-part structure was adopted in only 15% (n = 10) of the essays.

Seventy-seven percent of the comparison group's usage of \"think\" was to express personal opinions or ideas, e.g., \"I don't think urbanization is making our life better.\" For the experimental group, however, only 45% of cases were used in this way, while 55% of the instances of \"think\" were used in an attributive sense, i.e., ascribing other people's thoughts or beliefs, e.g., \"this would lead to a misunderstanding of parents who think that money will solve everything.\" Thus, the word \"think\" was used by a significantly higher percentage of students in the experimental group (p < .05) to project thoughts onto others.",

In the comparison group, the frequency of hypothetical arguments with the word \"if\" (31 cases) or in other forms (two cases of hypothesis with modals) was much lower. For instance, a student wrote, \"how nice if we keep living in the countryside!\" and another wrote, \"if we really want urbanization to make our life better, there is still a long way to go.\" By examining all the cases of the use of \"if,\" we saw that the comparison group also made hypothetical arguments, but at a lower frequency with less variety.

Using standardized indices, the comparison group outperformed the experimental group in aspects including essay length, lexical density, Fog index and word frequency. In other words, the comparison group collectively wrote longer essays that were more conventionally academic in nature based on various standard measures. This may have been due to the students' familiarity with the type of prompt as well as the object of inquiry (socio-cultural issue) in addition to having frequent practice with evaluative and hortative rhetorical functions. Studies have shown that topic familiarity and prompt type exert significant positive effects on the writing performance of students across proficiency levels (Stapleton, 2001; He & Shi, 2012) . Similarly, the more sophisticated lead-ins in the scripts of the comparison group again may have been products of repeated preparation. Another possible explanation for the longer and more academically conventional essays written by the comparison group is based on cognitive writing research, which notes that a reduced cognitive load (familiarity and preparation effects) can enable students to translate their thoughts with more ease and confidence, and hence write in a less stressful way (Fayol, 2012; Flower & Hayes, 1981) . In our case, the familiar topic more or less freed writers from attending to their syntax, which meant a reduced burden on working memory for the comparison group. In essence, lower level thinking processes may lead to smoother writing, while more complex thinking causes surface disruptions, but more interesting content.",

Since the whole writing process involves intensive cognitive activity, for a writer to compose more complex words and sentences she needs more cognitive capacity (Flower & Hayes, 1981) . The greater cognitive effort imposed by the unconventional writing prompt for the experimental group might have resulted in more diverse rhetorical and pragmatic dimensions in the students' essays (MacArthur & Graham, 2016) , which could also be viewed as providing an opportunity for student respondents to exercise their latent critical thinking abilities. Qualitative analysis of the scripts revealed that the comparison group used similar sentences in their essays with some writers copying sentences from the writing prompt. Many students in the comparison group, for example, began their essays with a similar, or even identical sentence. This may have caused the low scores in syntactic complexity and lexical diversity for the comparison group. The same may be said of the collective uniformity of organizational patterns noted in the paragraphs of the comparison group's scripts. In contrast, (the second interpretation) receiving an unfamiliar task and topic, which the exploratory prompt was meant to be, may have disadvantaged the writing performance of the students in the experimental group. Because of the shorter length, lower scores on the two standard measures, and inconsistent organization, the experimental group was clearly outperformed. Nevertheless, breaking the constraints of the \"three-part\" structure may be considered another positive cognitive payoff for the experimental group. We speculate that the diversity in the structure of essays could also be a sign of and stimulus for critical thinking.",

The use of hedges has been increasingly studied in undergraduate academic writing (e.g., Aull, 2015; Aull & Lancaster, 2014) . Researchers suggest that using hedges may be considered a crafted way of balancing conviction and caution by relatively advanced writers (Aull, 2015; Hyland, 2000) , but the nature of hedge use is still inconclusive.",

Likewise, the marked difference in the way the two groups used the word \"think\" is revealing. Rather than simply using this word to express personal beliefs as the comparison group tended to do, a significantly higher percentage of writers in the experimental group projected thoughts onto others -certainly a more challenging mental exercise both logically and linguistically. Undeniably, the isolation of two words where differences appeared between the two groups is not sufficient to make any generalizations beyond the present study; however, in the exploratory spirit, these examples illustrate how areas of omission, both logical and linguistic, can emerge when prompts gravitate towards the one-size-fitsall approach apparently taken by the high-stakes tests, especially TOEFL and IELTS.",

The thinking processes involved in problemsolving entail reflective and procedural mental activities, which demand more cognitive competence and higher-order thinking, and hence need practicing and cultivating (Halpern, 2003; Perkins & Tishman, 2001) . Thus, we argue that such problem-solution and behavior-interpretation in the writing tasks has important educational implications for critical thinking development.",

And this point regarding practical issues also raises concerns about scoring in high stakes tests: if such tests were to adopt a greater number of rhetorical functions and objects of inquiry, it would inevitably create reliability challenges due to the difficulty of creating scoring rubrics that encompass a wider range of texts. Or alternatively, if the specific type of prompt advocated in this study, i.e., one that encourages critical thinking, were adopted, then test takers may well begin preparing specifically for them, eventually resulting in more cookie-cutter conventional responses.",

This argument does have some merit as we did expect some differences to arise. However, the nature of these differences were unknown to us, and did not exist in the literature. Thus, the experimental prompt was meant to explore possibilities without intending to provide any conclusive answers. Secondly, ideally, after the first iteration of the study, the two groups would have reversed their roles and produced a second set of scripts for analysis, perhaps providing a more reliable measure of writing quality. Thus, in both of these senses, we framed the study as exploratory.",

In the same vein, the present study also seeks to unsettle the status quo. Because of concerns that the writing prompts in high-stakes language exams tend to converge around a narrow set of rhetorical functions and objects of inquiry, the present study sought to compare responses from students to a conventional prompt and an exploratory one. An analysis of the scripts from a comparison group who responded to a conventional prompt revealed that although this group performed better in terms of certain linguistic indexes, the test-takers' organization and language use was restricted to certain patterns and usages when compared to an experimental group that responded to the exploratory prompt. Given the impact that writing prompts in high-stakes exams have on language curriculums and classroom instruction pedagogy, these findings suggest a need to widen the scope of genres and topics in writing prompts that students are expected to respond to. And while this exploratory study investigating the impact of one rhetorical function and one object of enquiry on student writing can only hint at alternative types of patterns of writing and thinking, it gives impetus for research into broadening the scope of prompts in high stakes tests. New research may indicate there is potential to expand beyond the present narrow form of writing preferred by high stakes tests into new text types and topics which could trigger diversity and enhanced thinking processes.",
