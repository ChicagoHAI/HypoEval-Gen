    "abstract": "This paper reports findings from a systematic search of the empirical literature from 2000 to 2020 on the assessment of creativity in narrative writing. It seeks to synthesise the designs, methods and findings on how different disciplines have gathered relevant data to the question of how creativity in writing might be assessed, and feedback made more effective. It draws together the established knowledge base around two research questions. The methodology for the systematic involved searches on five academic databases for relevant keywords, producing 1796 papers. Initial screening of the abstracts identified 97 studies for further scrutiny, and for which full texts were accessed for secondary screening based on the inclusion criteria. The final 39 papers judged to satisfy the selection criteria were subject to in-depth analysis and synthesis. The findings of the review reveal that four main techniques have been utilised in efforts to assess creativity in writing, each with their own merits and limitations, and a paucity of research in several crucial areas. The review indicates that, while several disciplines have contributed to the knowledge base in this area, few interdisciplinary studies exist that draw together multiple techniques and provide clear answers for the research questions used in the study. Furthermore, there is little empirical evidence suggesting that assessment improves student creativity with regard to writing, and new research in the field would be advanced by addressing explicit definitions of creativity, the practices of writing 'experts', and writing considered within its social and cultural context.",

Thus, there is currently a lack of clear, widely adopted advice on what constitutes 'best practice' in creativity assessment for education. In research, the challenge of assessing creativity has been described as 'significant, yet complicated' (Turkman & Runco, 2019) ; methodologically, a number of dilemmas are created for the creativity scholarshould the research focus upon the creative individual, their approach or creative process, the product produced (see Sternberg, 1988 for an exploration of process and product creativity), or how it is perceived and received by others? How far should the influences behind the product, and its reception, be understood in relation to the sociocultural context in which the act of creativity took place? Should the research address 'Big-C' (eminent creativity, with high cultural value) or the more every day, 'little-c' creativity that all humans can demonstrate (Craft, 2000; Kaufman & Beghetto, 2009) ? Furthermore, what methods might adequately capture or measure these elements of creativity?",

                "text": "While the craft of writing may be the most accessible of the cultural domains in which creativity is studied (Csiksentmihalyi, 1997) , research has understood this in different ways. Cremin and Myhill (2012) discuss discrepancies between 'creative writing', a more genre-bound term largely restricted to arts-based, school and university writing curricula, and 'creativity in writing', a more inclusive approach acknowledging the creativity of most writing and linking to broader definitions of creativity, considering social and cultural elements. There remains a lack of clarity in the definition of creativity with reference to creative writing (Turkman & Runco, 2019) ; it is also interdisciplinary, involving cognitive, social, personality, and biological aspects of psychology (Sternberg, 2009) . Academics from the fields of linguistics and educational research have also contributed their insights. Language is intrinsically generative in nature (Chomsky, 1965) , and perhaps the best example of 'everyday' creativity (Runco, 2014) because of the immense repertoire of possibilities it affords. Writing has, therefore, been described as a creative meaning-making process achieved through the active and continued involvement of the writer with the unfolding text (Emig, 1988) . Writers can be understood as creative thinkers, problem-solvers and designers who are juggling with task constraints and drawing upon the creative and linguistic resources available (Sharples, 1999) . Some research (see for example Dymoke, 2003; Wilson, 2010) has addressed pedagogies for poetry assessment in the light of this perspective for 'little-c' creativity choices in writing, and thus this paper seeks to contribute insights with regard to the narrative genres. This paper seeks to synthesise the body of research produced in recent years and outline the merits and limitations within the adopted methodologies of the studies. The review is directed by two overarching research questions:",

Searches were run on five databases in November 2020 to identify studies relating to the assessment of creativity in writing: AEI (Australian Education Index), BEI (British Education Index), ERC (Education Research Complete), ERIC (Educational Resources Information Centre), and WOS (Web of Science). The search, while international in scope, was restricted to peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2020. The key search terms used were assessment and variants (assess* OR mark OR marking OR grade OR grading OR feedback), creativity (creativ* OR narrat*), and writing (writ*). Initial searches generated too many studies unrelated to creativity in writing and for which assessment was not a focus for the study; a proximity operator (N5) was therefore added between the terms creativity and writing to ensure that these two terms were loosely connected in the search results. The final search necessitated that the core term assessment and its variants appeared in the abstracts of papers, revealing a total of 1744 results which were then downloaded to EndNote X9 before duplicates were removed. A summary of the results generated by the searches is given in Table 1 .",

Studies were excluded if they were not published in English; were EFL-focused; did not address narrative, or were not empirical investigations. A total of 39 studies met all of the inclusion criteria (25 for the age range 5-15; and 14 for post-16 and professional education). In studies that involved both teachers and their students (e.g. Cremin et al., 2017 , in which both teacher and student voices are studied) the participants for whom findings were most pertinent to the research questions (in this case, the adult participants) determined which age range the file was added to.

One aim of this paper is to draw out knowledge specifically related to the features of narrative writing that was judged to exhibit such creativity, distinct from generic appraisals of classroom writing. 24 of the studies included rubrics or established measures of narrative or creative writing to aid in reaching their conclusions: some used generic rubrics for narrative writing designed to comprehensively assess student work, while others utilised explicit definitions of creativity to design their own measures. It is this latter group that constitutes the focus of this section: six studies that explicitly addressed the creativity of the writing and sought to wrestle with evidence of creative elements in the writing, moving beyond studies that employed more generic, sometimes vague writing criteria to assess writing performance; instead, this approach attempts to draw together features from the writing to contribute to a knowledge base for creativity theory. Of the six studies that address this research question, two are drawn from the pool that addressed participants aged 5-15 (Cheung, Tse & Tsang, 2001; Kettler & Bower, 2017) and four are drawn from the post-16 education and professional writing pool of studies (Ashton & Davies, 2015; Form, 2019; Furst, Ghisletta, & Lubart, 2017; Zedelius, Mills & Schooler, 2019) .",

The experiment tasked ten groups of participants with producing a narrative as instructed for the different phases of writingfor example, to avoid 'selection' behaviours, such as critically reviewing the work, during planning or drafting and to instead maximise 'generation' behaviours throughout the process. Four phases of writing (preparation, drafting, development and correction) scaffolded the different intensities of generation and selection for the different experimental groups. One group served as a control, and produced the text following their own process without interference or instruction.

The study found that the more creative works were produced with a high degree of 'Generation' or ideation at the start of the writing process, followed by increasing or high levels of criticality, or 'Selection'. This highlights the importance of the writer's rigour regarding their work after an initial spurt of generative thinking. However, none of the experimental groups outperformed the control group, who wrote normally. This suggests that those who responded to the stimulus without attempting to control the process demonstrated more creativity -insofar as they produced texts that were both original and of higher quality, by the authors' definition of creativity -than those who attempted to change or manipulate their writing processes as directed for the purposes of the study.",

                "text": "The Chinese Creative Writing Scale developed by (Cheung et al., 2001) is reportedly derived from the (Carlson Originality Scale, 1965) , with additional input from scales by (Torrance, 1965) and (Guilford, 1967) . Such instruments have helped establish the notion of 'divergent thinking' in creativity: the scale developed by (Carlson, 1965) , for example, draws on iterative analysis of 5000 children's stories, with both the definition of creativity used and process of refining the scale described in the paper's methods section. Similarly, the work of (Torrance, 1965) draws on three sets of studies involving 20,000 school children (Gowan, 1965) . Cheung et al. (2001) use these works to create a new scale for use with their sample in Hong Kong, noting cultural differences between Chinese and the West alongside grammatical and semantic structural contrasts. While the notion of exploring creative acts within their social and cultural context is central to creativity theory (Cremin & Myhill, 2012) in this paper there is little discussion of how these differences were resolved. Leong (2010 Leong ( , 2011)) , for example, considers the question of creativity in the East as contrasted to the West, and concludes that several core differences exist in the approach to creative output. Leong argues that in the East, including in Hong Kong, much of arts education is still attempting to recover from misinterpretations of the underlying beliefs behind Confucius' teachings on education (Leong, 2011) . Yet comparisons between 'East' and 'West' have become more challenging in a globalised world, especially where nationality may not constitute cultural membership (Craft, Gardner & Claxton, 2008) , and crucially, creativity is often a reaction to potentially inhibitive cultural factors (Runco, 2014) . The focus of the paper by (Cheung et al., 2001) is on establishing the validity of the rubric, though the authors could have offered valuable insight and demonstrated further rigour in adapting their scale to fit with what they justify as differences in language and culture, and contributed some of these details around socio-culturally determined notions of creativity in their discussion. Zedelius et al. (2019) utilise rubrics, raters, and linguistic computations to explore 'uniqueness of expression' in a study on the features of creative writing, corroborating assertions by (Turkman and Runco, 2019) on the potential of computerised scoring for new creativity tests. The rubric used for this study centres around the themes of image, voice, characterisation and story identified by (Mozaffari, 2013) , who reports identifying these qualities through a review of the literature on creative languageyet it is unclear from this study precisely what literature was reviewed, how appropriate material was sourced, or how these qualities were arrived at. The same criticism could be levelled at the generic rubric produced by (Vaezi and Rezaei, 2019) , another paper included in this review,",

(Form, 2019) which was developed through iterative consultation with multiple groups of experts responding to Likert questionnaires and unstructured interviews on the validity and reliability of the rubric throughout its design. Here, metrics demonstrating the experts' approval for the rubric's comprehensiveness is reported, while the rigour and validity of the qualitative analysis of the conversations with those consulted is not demonstratedfor example, transparency over complexities and contradictory statements arising through analysis. By contrast, (Ashton and Davies, 2015) contribute a rubric specific to the linked genres of science fiction and fantasy, though once again the design of the rubric is not discussed in detailthe main body of the paper discusses the methodology and results of an experiment exploring the potential of peer feedback. Consequently, once again the rigour and validity of the qualitative data informing the design of the rubric is not discussed. Nevertheless, the criteria described are potentially revealing and point to the value of genre-specific discussions with writers, editors and literary agents in identifying features of creative narrative writinginterestingly, the rubric produced does not give equal weight to all criteria, and focuses primarily on the effect of the writing on the intended audience. Some of these insights are precise, such as the idea of 'blocking' -concerning clarity over the spatial relationships between charactersand the writer's ability to engage the reader early in the piece. Furthermore, this study hints at the role of technical accuracy in the writing, with the rubric detailing 'distracting' errors, which may frame spelling and grammar mistakes in the context of creativitythey detract from the readers' experience of the product.",

Each of these methods utilises teachers' observations and ratings of students' personality characteristics to provide a list used by (Kettler and Bower, 2017) in their paper on measuring creative capacity in gifted students. This study (which sought to compare teacher ratings with student products in an exploration of the association of giftedness and creativity) could be critiqued for the use of a single teacher trained in gifted and talented education and with significant and positive relationships to the students' products. The criteria listed in the 'Creativity demonstrated in writing rubric' are revealing, however, and centre around notions of 'originality' and 'elaboration'.",

Despite this range, the majority of studies used these participants for providing numerical ratings; few studies, with the notable exception of (Cremin et al., 2017) gathered qualitative data on this topic for analysis. Ashton and Davies (2015) , for example, consulted with writers and agents in the genre of science fiction and fantasy and produced a rubric based on their views, but do not describe their views, the coding process, or discuss the nuances of this consultation further. Overall, few studies asked the participants about their practices when it came to assessing writing, and fewer still made use of observation to note differences between participants' claims in light of their practices. Consequently, little is known about the declarative and procedural knowledge of 'experts' regarding how they define creativity and what they value in creative products; this is particularly true of those immersed in the world of professional writing such as literary agents, editors, professional writers and university creative writing tutors. Cremin et al. (2017) include some insights into authors' assessment and feedback practices in their mixed methods study, combining a qualitative dataset with results from a randomised controlled trial to explore the impact of partnerships between writers and teachers. In their reflections on how feedback had impacted on their own development, the professional authors who participated in this study highlighted perceptive criticism, encouragement, subjectivity and choice in the nature of feedback from peers and collaborators in the world of professional writing. When partnered with teachers in schools, these writers engaged heavily and directly with students on the 'grittier' aspects of drafting, critically addressing children's writing in the classroom forum and referring back to the children's authorial intent. Indeed, observations of adult feedback given at a writers' residential in this study noted that it sought to explore the writers' intention for each piece and was characterised by the sharing of the more experienced writer's sharing of craft knowledge in achieving this goal. In workshops, tutor and peer feedback was public and sought to precisely critique or praise the effect of the writing on the audience, the writer's particular skill, key features of the piece or holistic discussions of the piece as a whole. The study highlights public peer and tutor feedback, and individual conferencing as appropriate practices.",

Despite this, the literature around the assessment practices of teachers when it comes to writing emphasises that this group of experts tends to focus more on correcting errors around writing conventions, such as spelling and grammar. In their study of 10,585 assessment messages by 41 teachers in Spain, (Lucero, Fern\u00e1ndez and Montanero, 2018) revealed the predominance of specific grammar and spelling mistakes, which in turn were the best predictor of the overall grade given and neglected other semantic, rhetorical or pragmatic aspects of the children's writing. A similar study by (Peterson, Childs and Kennedy, 2006) with 108 teachers in Canada noted that teachers were generally reluctant to engage with the ideologies in students' writing and tended to indicate and make a greater number of corrections, particularly when the work was attributed to a male student writer. Consequently, other studies included in the review find that, in turn, students show a tendency to focus on these conventional elements toofor example, (Taggart and Laughlin, 2017) explored the students' emotive responses to such feedback. DeBenedictus (2009) highlights the importance of uncovering students' perceptions of the features 'quality' narrative writing. Gulley (2012) included groups for oral, written or mixed feedback, and categorised feedback using a form to comment on statement, content, organisation, sensory details, grammar, and style. Overall, however, there is a paucity of research on the nature of feedback provided for creativity in the writing classroom, particularly at the university level.",

However, these studies utilised their judgments rather than seeking to unpick their practices and understandings regarding creativity in writing. One of the frontiers for research in this area is examining who exactly qualifies as an 'expert', and where a balance can be struck between recruiting for purpose and recruiting for convenience when it comes to academic research. Kaufman, Gentile and Baer (2005) reported a strong degree of correlation between the ratings of gifted creative writing students and an 'expert' panel of teachers, writers, and creativity psychologists. Despite being older, a limited correlation between university students and published writers in rating stories for their creativity was then found by (Kaufman, Baer and Cole, 2009) , with the experts tending to rate lower for creativity than the novice raters, who also demonstrated lower inter-rater reliability and less consistency in their ratings than the expert writers. Further research is needed to establish the parameters and nature of these differences and to unpick the craft knowledge understood by these expert groups.",

Ten of the studies included in this review utilised some form of the CAT to assess creativity in writing, largely authored by the same group of psychologists testing the technique in a variety of circumstances and fields: due to its grounding in creativity as a socially-constructed quality, the CAT is an interesting tool for testing notions of creativity in different contexts. For example, (Baer, Kaufman and Gentile, 2004) obtained high levels of inter-rater reliability using the consensual assessment technique for a panel of judges including teachers, writers and editors, and psychologists for three different types of writingstories, personal narratives, and poemssuggesting the technique can be extended to nonparallel creative products.",

Some of the included studies (for example, Furst, Ghisletta, & Lubart, 2017; Kelly, Knight, Peck & Reel, 2003; Ng & Yeung, 2011) circumvented this issue by modifying the technique slightly, combining it with the use of more precise criteria to yield more revealing insights. Several studies have also identified how specific procedural choices impact the CAT's reliability as a measure, and researchers' depth of knowledge about procedures and their effects still remains incomplete (Cseh & Jeffries, 2019) . A further criticism is that it cannot yield standardized scores the way many achievement tests can: the creativity of the artifacts, ideas, or performances in a group is judged in relation to each other, not some pre-established standard (Baer & Kaufman, 2019) . But the main limitation with the CAT is practicalit is logistically difficult to source appropriate judges (Kaufman, Baer, Cole & Sexton, 2008) , and therefore to use in the classroom context.",

By contrast, (Kaufman et al., 2004) used the CAT with a larger pool of judges and found no significant differences between African American-Caucasian differences on any of three writing tasks; the only significant differences in creativity ratings occurred in poetry between Latino-Caucasian groups and Latino-Asian groups. In her discussion of Creative Writing at MA Level, (Newman, 2007) notes that students with different cultural memberships can find these nuances in value systems for creativity frustrating, and that in writing out of a different tradition they can find themselves sidelined. This is one further issue with the CAT: it perhaps unfairly disadvantages certain children where elements such as socio-economic status, writing in a second language, and differing cultures and environments affect socio-culturally determined notions of creativity.",

                "text": "One of the limitations around the use of rubrics concerns where the criteria come from. In her analysis of the underlying beliefs and values about writing that underpin writing curricula in Canada, (Peterson, 2012) notes how criteria can favour some writing discourses, and sideline others. Rubrics can thus be highly influenced by political agendas and curriculum drivers, and can impose a framework onto the writing. Despite listing a set of criteria to look for in the work, they are often also subjective in nature and can result in writing that displays several desirable features, but which may lack other important elements. Further to this, many rubrics tend to give relatively equal emphasis to each of the criterion included, where there instead may be nuances around these, and may be influenced by different conceptions of creativity. Several of the studies thrown up by the literature search more generally reported rating for the presence of a desired story feature, rather than its execution or the design choices around this. Gardner (2012) argues for genre-specific criteria in rubrics, finding that students scored significantly higher with a rubric more precise to narrative writing than a generic one. Yet genre (within the general umbrella of fiction) was not an overt concern for the majority of the studies included in the review, with most of them specifying no genre or a mix of genres (17). When genres were detailed, these were obscure; for example, recounting a memory or dream (6), the story of a town hero (2), a prompt involving seasons or the weather (2), science fiction (2), fantasy (1), fable (1), crime (1), and unspecified multimedia (1). There is a gap in the literature regarding the assessment of creativity in writing for most of the major narrative genres, such as romance, action, mystery, horror, or historical fiction. Furthermore, relatively few studies have identified characteristics for creativity in writing and, while there is a degree of consensus amongst them, further research is needed to produce a framework for assessment purposes in the writing classroom. Such criteria can be problematic, and difficult to identify in the context of academic research - (Zedelius et al., 2019) , for example, define 'voice' as \"unique and recognizable if you, when reading another piece by the same author, would recognise that it is written by the same author\" (Zedelius et al., 2019. 891) . In this instance, research would arguably have to work with several pieces of writing to identify such 'voice', and to be able to identify the writers in order to then zoom in on how this was achieved. Notions of originality, which also appeared in several rubrics, must be understood in context and defined furtheris a text original if it creates an entirely new form, or alters an existing one? Similarly, testimonials from professional writers often discuss 'quality' and 'voice' as achieved through several drafts (see, for example, Bingham, 2014; Lamott, 1995; Magrs, Lodge, Jones & Bell, 2001) , while research often works with a first draft produced under controlled conditions, aiming to assess blindly and for objectivity regarding the writers' intentions, influences and backgrounds, as well as the writing's social and cultural context, in order to generate findings on the subjects as a collective.",

                "text": "The third method for assessing creativity in writing related to the collective and individual responses of children and adults within the writing classroom itself. Peer assessment and feedback featured in several of the included studies. Some studies observed and analysed the nature of these interactions (Cremin et al., 2017; Peterson, 2003; Rojas-Drummond, Albarr\u00e1n & Littleton, 2008) . Others (such as Ashton & Davies, 2015; Ng & Yeung, 2011) collected ratings from peers and analysed these as quantitative data. Peer assessment allows for some subjectivity and expression of the diversity of different effects on the reader when it comes to the 'little-c' creativity choices made by the writer. While it is easy to operationalise in the classroom, peer feedback can be more difficult to capture, analyse and code into a generalisable framework, in part due to this diversity of responses and the element of subjectivity. Arguably, it is therefore limited in terms of identifying particular features of the writing or measuring to some objective standard. Despite this challenge, (Peterson, 2003) claims to have been able to able to trace revisions made in the writing to peer interactions, and such interactions may allow for different social and cultural notions of creativity to be discussed and appreciated. Cremin et al. (2017) highlight the potential of peer and expert feedback, but note a certain element of craft knowledge at play in the giving and receiving of constructive criticism, and sensitivity to the social, emotional and cognitive demands of writing and revising drafts. Indeed, craft knowledge appears to play a role in several of the studies, where participants received training before rating for creativity, using rubrics, or providing feedbackdecisions made by the research team, presumably, to provide a vocabulary for creative writing or a hierarchy of ideas for the participants to draw upon when making their decisions. The importance of this is most sharply evident in (Ashton and Davies, 2015) in which the peer group trained in the use of the rubric was more closely aligned with expert's rating than the group that did not receive training. One potential pitfall of peer assessment is highlighted in this study, in that both student groups displayed a tendency to rate most texts towards the centre of the scale (central tendency rating error), deviating little from average ratings even for texts that the experts rated as much lower or higher in quality.",

In one examination of the first 1000 words of 92 bestsellers' linguistic originality, (Form, 2019) found that the writers' use of relatively rarer words (for example, 'wuthering') and new word formations (for example, 'Muggle') were a significant predictor of the bestsellers' popularity, a finding with implications for the level of emphasis that writing teachers afford to aspects of style and vocabulary choices. This was an effect that remained significant after controlling for the year of first publishing and the gender of the author. Zedelius et al. (2019) also conceived of style as visible and distinctive through application of stylistic tools but established other metrics for the writers' voice, image and originality in their linguistic computations. The results of this study compared the computerised metrics of text cohesion and readability to human ratings of creativity, finding that linguistic features predicted the ratings to a significant degree. This suggests that at least some aspects of creative writing can be captured by computerised measures, and that different pieces of writing could possibly be compared to some objective standard despite their uniqueness.",

Similarly, (Yeung, Ho, Chan and Chung, 2017) found that spelling, transcription, and oral narrative skills were unique and important predictors of Chinese writing performance. Dockrell, Connelly, Walter and Critten (2015) and (Diercks-Gransee, Weissenburger, Johnson and Christensen, 2009) scored student writing for productivity and text accuracy, though findings are inconclusive with regard to the relevance of these measures for assessing the creativity of the writing used in these studies. In summary, word-level approaches appear to have the potential to provide some revealing results, but nevertheless could not be very effectively operationalised in the classroom and allows for little in the way of subjective interpretation of the creativity evidenced in the writing, instead attempting to identify objective features.",

Further research will need to address some of the complexities around such judgements and the reasons for them, unpicking differences in what participants state about creativity in writing in the light of how this manifests in their feedback, judgements, and practices. Relevant studies within the final pool of studies suggest that distinctions exist regarding the writer's command of audience, structure, ideas, character and setting as opposed to the technical aspects of writing, with teachers demonstrating a tendency to focus on correcting these latter errors and professional writing tutors and examiners privileging the former in the context of the writers' intentions for their piece, and the choices made to achieve this.",

In a similar way, the genre of a piece of narrative writing appears to have been important in the studies reviewed, for example in the precise items identified and included in the rubric produced by (Ashton and Davies, 2015) , yet creativity within several key narrative genres have not been studied in the recent empirical literature. The majority of the studies (17) did not specify the genre of writing used for the research, used a mix of creative narrative writing, or made use of open tasks whereby students could interpret a stimulus how they wished and, therefore, produced a range of outcomes. Six studies required students to use dreams or memories as a basis for their narrative writing: other genres that guided writing used for the studies included stories based on the weather or seasons, science fiction, stories whereby a character becomes a hero, and other highly specific scenarios.",

Few highquality qualitative or mixed-methods studies have been conducted exploring or providing a basis for further research. The majority of studies used only quantitative data in their analysis: some of these involved experiments or quasi-experiments (7), while others used a non-experimental design such as the CAT or a survey to gather data for analysis (20), and provide limited contributions to the research questions used in this review in unpicking evidence of creativity in writing. Just five studies combined both quantitative and qualitative datasets for analysis, but without directly addressing the research questions of this review even these are limited in how far, and how accurately, we can know anything on the topic of effectively assessing the creativity of narrative writing. Seven of the studies reviewed focused only on qualitative data; however, rigour in qualitative research was a recurring issue with several of the studies, or the literature used to design the instruments used in them, particularly with regard to how themes and criteria were identified and adequacy of the discussion around this. There was also a lack of studies that harnessed the use of multiple techniques for assessing creativity in writing. Due to the merits and limitations of each other techniques identified in this review, it is suggested that more studies that adopt an interdisciplinary approach utilising several measures for creativity, attending to the social and cultural aspects that influence it, will no doubt enrich and broaden the field and aid in the design of evidenced creativity assessment frameworks that could be operationalised in the writing classroom.

Four key research methods have been identified in the literature for assessing creativity in writing: rubrics, linguistic computations, peer feedback, and the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT), each with their own merits and limitations, which have been discussed in reference to the wider body of creativity and writing research. The review finds that relatively little is understood for what is valued in writing by 'experts' in the world of professional writing, and has discussed gaps in the body of research concerning genre and the potential importance of genre in articulating precise criteria. While there is also currently limited evidence that formative assessment for creativity in writing improves student creativity, the role of feedback in determining progress and the potential impacts on the accuracy of peer assessment have been outlined.

It is recommended that research make greater use of the experts identified in this field, producing high-quality qualitative studies that reveal rich insight into the topic under discussion from those immersed in the world of professional creativity in writing, with close attention to the texts produced and the ways in which qualitative coding arrives at themes and characteristics for creativity in writing.

The frequency of these corrections is, additionally, the best predictor of the global grade given by the teacher for the composition. Concludes that teachers of compulsory education approach assessment of narrative texts from a conception which places excessive emphasis on more local and superficial aspects of the composition in detriment of other semantic, rhetorical or pragmatic aspects. Some teachers, however, mostly in Secondary Education, also recorded non-corrective assessment content, such as markings, questions, suggestions for expansion, or justifications.

The process of iterative co-evaluation with rubric resulted in a clear improvement in the organization and contents of the narrative texts (mainly in the description of the characters and in the story setting) while the students assessed by their teachers improved, significantly, their grammar and, above all, spelling mistakes. The analysis showed that the process discourse predominates in all writing curricula.

No significant differences for gender on any of the tasks and no significant African American-Causasian differences on any of the writing tasks. Only significant differences in creativity ratings occurred in poetry between Latino-Causcasian groups and Latino-Asian groups. Kaufman et al. (2005) , USA Do gifted student writers and creative writing experts rate creativity the same way? How much did raters in each group (novice and expert) agree with each other? What is the relationship of the novice raters to the expert raters?8 gifted creative writers who had been accepted to a highly selective arts school. 13 expert judges consisting of middle school teachers, published creative writers, and psychologists who studied creativity. 27 short stories and 28 poems selected from the 1998 NAEP Classroom Writing Study.Participants independently rated the poems and short stories on a scale of 1-6 (not creative/highly creative) and submitted by mail. Quantitative dataset. Coefficient alpha interrater reliability analysis for RQ2; Pearson correlation coefficients for RQ3.Strong agreement amongst experts, and agreement amongst gifted students within accepted standards. Strong degree of correlation between the ratings of gifted students and experts (r = 0.78 for poems and r = 0.77 for short stories) Kettler and Bower (2017) , USA What is the relationship between the teacher's rating of student creativity and students' creative writing samples? Do identified gifted students score higher than general education students on the creative writing samples? Are there gender differences in the teacher's ratings of student creativity and/or in the creative writing products? Independent 'expert' judges (N = 8 for writing experts, comprising 4 writers and 4 language teachers; N = 7 for reading judges, comprising 4 PhD students and 3 teachers) 19 students in the penultimate year of pre-university education. Mix of good and poor readers (performance and motivations established by teacher identification and/or participation in a previous related study) Short story; haiku poem; poem with 5 given words; Sensory flashback story; recipe for a bad mood.Rating criteria consisting of 'task appropriateness', 'originality', 'technical quality' and 'personal engagement' amounting to final holistic rating for 'creative writing performance'. Quantitative dataset. Z-scores, Mann-Whitney U tests and effect size calculated. Multilevel estimates of variance and covariance to explore correlation between reading ability and writing quality.The results suggest that a positive relationship exists between literature reading and creative writing ability. Moreover, it shows that both constructs can be measured in reliable ways. Good literary readers outperformed the latter group (poor literary readers) in literature reading and in creative writing. A high correlation between literature reading ability and creative writing ability was found not only for the sample as a whole (r = 0.82), but also within the two \"extreme groups\" (r = 0.79).

Descriptive statistics and ANCOVA test, onesample t-test, multivariate analysis conducted.Hierarchical multiple regression results showed that spelling and oral narrative skills were unique predictors of Chinese writing performance. The significant interaction effect of grade and spelling showed that transcription skills played a more important role in Chinese writing performance amongst sixth graders than amongst fourth graders. Together, the present results provide important support for the \"simple view of writing\" model and underscore the importance of transcription skills and oral narrative skills in children's writing development in Chinese."

                "text": "Zedelius et al. (2019), USA If every piece of writing is unique, can we nonetheless compare different pieces and evaluate them according to some objective standard, or is creativity purely subjective? Study 1: 6 independent raters and 133 undergraduate students (88 F, 44 M, 1NB). All of the participants majored in psychology and participated in the study in exchange for course credit. Study 2: 5 independent raters and 128 undergraduate students (83 F, 44 M, and one who did not indicate gender; mean age = 20.1 years, SD = 3.8). The students participated in exchange for money. The major difference in Study 2 was that we made a specific effort to recruit a more heterogeneous sample of participants, including students with an interest in creative writing. No overlapping participants between studies.Evaluation rubric correlated with established creativity measures, including Alternate Uses Task (AUT); Compound remote associates (CRA) problems; Creative Behaviour Inventory (CBI) short self-report form. The rubric used by the independent raters detailed aspects and examples for three broad qualities desired in narrative writing:\u2022 Image: vivid sensory detail; rich, concrete details; figurative devices/tropes such as metaphor and personification; thinking or speaking voices if appropriate; and lacking elements of 'flat' writing (generalisations and vague abstractions). \u2022 Voice: visible and distinctive style including choice of words and application of vocabulary in refreshing ways; mix of sentence structures; use of metaphor or comparison; and use of page layout, punctuation and italics/capitals. Furthermore, command of humour, 'darkness', control over simplicity and/ or complexity, intentional choice of narration and different narrative perspectives or tones for a particular effect. \u2022 Originality: unusual or unexpected choices of material for the storyline or details within the story (e.g. characters and their attributes, or setting) including conceptual or philosophical departure from conventional approaches to the task. 1-3 scale (poor, fair or very good) based on the combination of these three story attributes.Quantitative dataset.Coh-Metrix to Genre Method used to assess writing, Type of data produced, Data analysis and Summary of findings analyse metrics of text cohesion and readability (predicts story evaluations through computing narrativity, deep cohesion, referential cohesion, syntactic simplicity, and word concreteness); and LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry/Word Count) to identify categories of the text content."
