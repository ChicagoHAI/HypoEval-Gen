Marks provide students with significant information about their performance and progress and further enable outsiders to make decisions based on students' qualifications (Harmer, 2007) . However, it is not without limitations. Many assessment techniques lack sufficient validity and reliability (Baer & McKool, 2009) and low marks might lead to low self-esteem and subsequently discourage students (Kroll, 1997) . Theses pros and cons would intensify in evaluating creative writing since \"here students produce and are therefore in charge of the content to some degree; they are personally involved in what comes from their own imagination. Teachers also function as individual readers with their own tastes and prejudices\" (Kroll, 1997, p. 1) .",

Accordingly, various tests have been developed to assess creativity based on this concept.

Despite the fact that this method benefits from high degrees of validity, it has two major drawbacks: (a) It is highly resource intensive since it requires an average panel of 10 expert judges, and (b) it is based on subjective judgment of experts who rely on their sense of what is creative in a specific domain to rate creativity (Baer & Mckool, 2009) .",

Creative writing \u2026will show a clear understanding of the reader's needs and those of genre. (May, 2007 p. 73) On the other hand, some of the criteria are hardly related to creativity in language. It is certainly true that qualities such as organization and mechanics are crucial for every piece of writing. However, the criteria set for evaluating writing depend on the purpose one wants to achieve (May, 2007) . Since the primary purpose of creative writing is to achieve creativity in language, its assessment should focus on such features. Nonetheless, in the guidelines that Saskatchewan (1998) and later NCTE (2004) set for creativity assessment more than half of the scores is devoted to non-creative features (mechanics, organization and structure). Moreover, Durham University's (2013) rubric marks creative writings for aspects such as tense and conjunctions. This problem has even penetrated assessment at M.A. level. Correctness of grammar, vocabulary, syntax and spelling are among the key criteria which Newman (2007) sets out for evaluation of creative writing.",

                "text": "Rubrics are one of the most widely used tools of assessing writing. To put it simply, a rubric is \"a set of criteria for grading assignments\" (Rezaie & Lovorn, 2010). Generally, they are of two types: (a) holistic rubrics which evaluate the overall quality of writing, and (b) analytical rubrics which focus on different aspects of writing (Weigle, 2002) . The contemporary research on assessment has proved the significance of analytical scales for a more reliable assessment of creativity (Jonsson & Savingby, 2007). The idea is so influential that Shraplin and Morris (2013), like many others, regard analytical marking as the most reliable and consistent method of assessing creative writing. They further argue that an optimal analytical marking should encompass qualities of creative writing and set categories of achievement to describe how far each quality has been achieved. As stated earlier, although the literature includes several grading grids, most of them suffer from lack of validity and reliability. Thus, this study attempts to develop an analytical rubric which encompasses major qualities theoretically linked to creativity. To this end, the literature on qualities of creative language was reviewed. It was found that creative writing includes 4 major qualities including image, voice, characterization and story (Burroway, 2011; Mills, 2006) . All criteria together with their descriptors are presented in Table 1 . In what follows there is a brief explanation on each of these attributes.",

Mills (2006) even goes further and maintains that \"no one can write anything of significance\u2026 unless imagination is allowed to play a part in the process\" (p. 12). An image is \"a word or series of words that evoke one or more of our senses\" (Burroway, 2011, p. 15) . According to Burroway, creative writing is a kind of vivid writing which refrains from three major elements of flat writing including: (a) abstractions: concepts which cannot be experienced through the senses (love), (b) generalizations: words which include too many of a specific group and thus cannot be visualized (everything), and (c) judgments: tell the reader directly how to think about something instead of showing it (she was very lazy). Generally, there are two ways of creating images (Burroway, 2011, p. 17):",

This is often accomplished through: (a) action: what a character does through the narrative, (b) thought: what a character thinks about, how a character thinks about his/her surrounding, (c) dialogue: what a character says and how it is said, (d) setting: where and when a character is situated in, and (e) symbol: objects and details which signify various information about a character such as names, entertaining choices, etc. (Saskatchewan, 1998).

This might mean how far a test or rubric measures consistently over subsequent ratings (intra-rater reliability) or among various raters (inter-rater reliability) (Mackey & Gass, 2005) . To explore the reliability of the proposed rubric, 32 samples of creative writing from two distinct classes were collected and analyzed using the rubric. In fact, Iranian English curriculum does not include any creative writing courses. However, due to the requirements of an M.A. thesis conducted in Guilan University, two literature classes were employed to teach creative writing. Thus, the writings of these two classes were used for investigating the reliability of the rubric. To this end, two individual raters evaluated the whole sample using the analytical rubric. Approximately two weeks later, the same raters repeated the evaluation. Correlation coefficient for scores given by two different raters (inter-rater reliability) and for subsequent ratings (intra-rater reliability) was 0.79 and 0.89, respectively. Although these values are not extremely high, according to Brown, Glasswell and Harland (2004) a reliability index of 0.70 proves to be sufficient for structured rubrics.",

To estimate whether the proposed rubric truly measures creativity in writing, we explored how far the grades assigned using the rubric correlated with an experienced teacher's ranking of the same sample. To this end, firstly the average score was calculated across the two graders for all the 32 papers. Due to the absence of creative writing in Iranian English curriculum, there was no possibility to find an expert of creative writing in the country. However, a distinguished professor of literature helped us in this regard. Sixteen papers which represented a range of average scores were selected from the sample to be evaluated by the judge. He was asked to rank-order the papers based on his knowledge of what creativity in writing might involve. Finally, the Spearman rankorder correlation coefficient between the judge's rankings and the rankings based on the average score of the papers using the rubric was calculated. The correlation coefficient between the two sets of score was 0.70. Furthermore, the mean Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient between rankings of the two raters who assessed the writings with the rubric was 0.61. Thus, the correlation between rankings of those who used the rubric and the judge who applied his own criteria is comparable to the correlation between raters who used the rubric and the same explicitly stated criteria. This result signifies the validity of the rubric.",

Her father was an executive in a dress manufacturing company and was able to afford his family all the luxuries and comforts of life. But Debbie was completely indifferent to her family's affluence.Analysis:-Image: poor, the work is replete with judgments and generalizations: Judgment: She was stubborn-She was independent-She was indifferent to her family's affluence.
