That means they meet a teacher once into two weeks to discuss and clarify the mistakes they made in their assignments (i.e. essays), which together with a deeper selfstudy of the materials implemented in their on-line e-learning course, they write every second week. Therefore, the course undoubtedly contributes to the development and support of more interactive strategies. Students also have an easy access to ample materials, which they can exploit on their own from the cosiness of their homes. They can get an immediate feedback on the on-line exercises. If they have a problem, they can contact a tutor and they do not have to wait until next lesson. Furthermore, the teacher has got more time to read their essays and discuss possible mistakes with the students in class and reinforce the correct use of the language. In addition, the course tries to develop students' thinking skills. For example, an argumentative writing task will demand of students that they consciously implement and integrate both lower-and higher-order thinking skills. Undoubtedly, all these increase students' motivation and their stimulation to work.",

Criterion-referenced assessment, typically using a criterion-referenced test, as the name implies, occurs when candidates are measured against defined (and objective) criteria. Criterion-referenced assessment is often, but not always, used to establish a person's competence (whether s/he can do something). The best known example of criterion-referenced assessment is the driving test, when learner drivers are measured against a range of explicit criteria (such as \"Not endangering other road users\"). Norm-referenced assessment (colloquially known as \"grading on the curve\"), typically using a norm-referenced test, is not measured against defined criteria. This type of assessment is relative to the student body undertaking the assessment. It is effectively a way of comparing students. The IQ test is the best known example of norm-referenced assessment. Many entrance tests (to prestigious schools or universities) are norm-referenced, permitting a fixed proportion of students to pass (\"passing\" in this context means being accepted into the school or university rather than an explicit level of ability). This means that standards may vary from year to year, depending on the quality of the cohort; criterion-referenced assessment does not vary from year to year (unless the criteria change). Ipsative assessment is self comparison either in the same domain over time, or comparative to other domains within the same student.",
